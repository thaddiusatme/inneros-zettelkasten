- Established audit trail requirements and privacy defaults (`visibility: private`)
- Notes affected: context-window-metaphor, tdd-context-code-review, freelancing-for-work, diablo-2-druid-alt, automated-voice-memo-routing

### feat: Complete template migration to YAML frontmatter schema (18:55)
- Successfully migrated all note templates to use standardized YAML frontmatter
- Updated templates: `fleeting.md`, `permament.md`, `weekly-review.md`, `permanent Note Mornign Check In Template.md`
- Template `content-idea.md` already had proper YAML frontmatter
- All templates now follow schema: `type`, `created`, `status`, `tags`, `visibility`
- Preserved all existing Templater script functionality
- Default privacy setting: all notes set to `visibility: private`
- Tested successfully: created `fleeting-2025-07-20-test.md` with proper YAML frontmatter
- Templates now fully compatible with Obsidian plugins (Dataview, etc.)

### feat: Update privacy model and gitignore configuration (19:05)
- Updated `.gitignore` to remove blanket exclusion of `fleeting-*.md` files

- Fixed syntax error in regex pattern that was split across lines (line 122-123)
- Verified script passes Python syntax validation (`python3 -m py_compile`)
- Implementation includes three main classes:
  - `TemplateParser`: Extracts Templater scripts, YAML frontmatter, and legacy markdown metadata
  - `TemplateGenerator`: Creates standardized YAML frontmatter while preserving Templater functionality
  - `TemplateMigrator`: Orchestrates migration with backup support and dry-run mode

### Test: Add temporary file to verify post-commit hook (15:41)
### Pre-Commit Hook Enhancement (14:22)
- Fixed a critical bug in the pre-commit hook that allowed commits to pass despite validation failures.
- Improved the hook's file selection logic to exclude project-level markdown files (e.g., README, Changelog) and the entire `.automation` directory.
- The hook now correctly validates only the intended note files, ensuring repository integrity.

### TDD Setup & Validation Test Suite (14:18)
- Established a Test-Driven Development (TDD) environment to improve code quality and reliability.
- Created a `tests` directory within the `.automation` folder.
- Set up a `requirements.txt` file with `pytest` and `pyyaml` dependencies.
- Implemented an initial test suite (`test_validate_metadata.py`) for the metadata validation script.
- Wrote tests covering date validation, frontmatter extraction, and full metadata validation logic.
- Created mock data files (`valid_note.md`, `invalid_note.md`, `missing_frontmatter_note.md`) for robust testing.
- Identified and fixed a bug in the test data related to YAML comment parsing, achieving a "green" test state with all tests passing.

### Phase 2: Auto-Repair Script Implementation (11:05)
- Created `repair_metadata.py` script with comprehensive auto-repair capabilities:
  - Automatically adds missing YAML frontmatter to notes
  - Fixes malformed YAML (removes hashtags from tags, fixes formatting)
  - Adds missing required fields (type, created, status) with sensible defaults
  - Converts datetime objects to proper string format (YYYY-MM-DD)
  - Extracts metadata from old-style template format and migrates to YAML
- Features:
  - Non-destructive operation with automatic backup creation
  - Dry-run mode for testing before applying changes
  - Batch processing for directories and entire InnerOS system
  - Detailed reporting of all repairs made
  - Smart metadata inference from file paths and content
- Test Results:
  - Dry run identified 51 out of 53 notes needing repairs
  - Common issues: missing frontmatter (30+ notes), malformed tags with hashtags
  - Script successfully prepared fixes for all identified issues

### Automation Validation Testing (10:54)
