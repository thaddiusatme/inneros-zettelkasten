# Windsurf Project Changelog

## 2025-07-20

### Test: Add temporary file to verify post-commit hook (15:41)
### Pre-Commit Hook Enhancement (14:22)
- Fixed a critical bug in the pre-commit hook that allowed commits to pass despite validation failures.
- Improved the hook's file selection logic to exclude project-level markdown files (e.g., README, Changelog) and the entire `.automation` directory.
- The hook now correctly validates only the intended note files, ensuring repository integrity.

### TDD Setup & Validation Test Suite (14:18)
- Established a Test-Driven Development (TDD) environment to improve code quality and reliability.
- Created a `tests` directory within the `.automation` folder.
- Set up a `requirements.txt` file with `pytest` and `pyyaml` dependencies.
- Implemented an initial test suite (`test_validate_metadata.py`) for the metadata validation script.
- Wrote tests covering date validation, frontmatter extraction, and full metadata validation logic.
- Created mock data files (`valid_note.md`, `invalid_note.md`, `missing_frontmatter_note.md`) for robust testing.
- Identified and fixed a bug in the test data related to YAML comment parsing, achieving a "green" test state with all tests passing.

### Phase 2: Auto-Repair Script Implementation (11:05)
- Created `repair_metadata.py` script with comprehensive auto-repair capabilities:
  - Automatically adds missing YAML frontmatter to notes
  - Fixes malformed YAML (removes hashtags from tags, fixes formatting)
  - Adds missing required fields (type, created, status) with sensible defaults
  - Converts datetime objects to proper string format (YYYY-MM-DD)
  - Extracts metadata from old-style template format and migrates to YAML
- Features:
  - Non-destructive operation with automatic backup creation
  - Dry-run mode for testing before applying changes
  - Batch processing for directories and entire InnerOS system
  - Detailed reporting of all repairs made
  - Smart metadata inference from file paths and content
- Test Results:
  - Dry run identified 51 out of 53 notes needing repairs
  - Common issues: missing frontmatter (30+ notes), malformed tags with hashtags
  - Script successfully prepared fixes for all identified issues

### Automation Validation Testing (10:54)
- Tested validation tools on existing notes in the system
- Discovered widespread YAML frontmatter issues across notes:
  - Most notes (30+ files) missing frontmatter entirely
  - Several notes with malformed YAML (particularly unquoted hashtags in tags)
  - Missing required fields in notes with frontmatter
  - Date format inconsistencies (datetime objects vs. strings)
- Created template for AI conversation context to facilitate project continuity
- Identified requirements for Phase 2 auto-repair functionality

## 2025-07-19
### Automation Implementation (23:45)
- Set up automation directory structure (`.automation/scripts`, `hooks`, `config`, `logs`, `reports`)
- Created Git pre-commit hook for metadata validation
- Developed Python script for validating YAML frontmatter in markdown files
- Created YAML configuration file for validation parameters
- Integrated configuration loading into validation script
- Ensured non-destructive operation with validation-only functionality
- Created comprehensive README for the automation system
- Developed user-friendly CLI tool for manual validation with fix suggestions

### Automation Planning (23:00)
- Created comprehensive Automation Project Manifest document
- Defined automation scope, components, and implementation phases
- Established four key automation layers: Git Integration, Note Management, AI Enhancement, and Workflow Automation
- Outlined technical approach and success metrics for automation project
- Set up phased implementation plan with clear deliverables

### Version Control Setup (22:51)
- Initialized Git repository for version control of InnerOS directory
- Created appropriate .gitignore file to exclude temporary and system files
- Performed initial commit of organized directory structure
- Documented version control setup and benefits in README.md

### Cleanup (22:50)
- Removed temporary scripts and log files created during extension fix process:
  - Deleted fix_double_md_extensions.sh, fix_extensions.sh, and fix_md_extensions.py scripts
  - Removed log files: double_md_fix_log.txt, extension_fix_log.txt, python_fix_log.txt
- Ensured clean directory structure with only essential files

### File Extension Fix (20:14)
- Fixed double ".md.md" extensions in Content Pipeline files:
  - Renamed 16 files in Idea Backlog directory to have single .md extension
  - Renamed 5 files in Pre-Prooduction directory to have single .md extension
  - Created Python script (`fix_md_extensions.py`) to handle the renaming with proper path handling
  - Updated internal links in markdown files to reference the corrected filenames
  - Generated detailed log of all changes in `python_fix_log.txt`

### Broken Links Resolution (20:05)
- Created missing concept notes to fix broken links in Permanent Notes:
  - Whisper + LLM Prompt Engineering
  - Voice-First Ops for Lean Teams
  - Support SOP System Map
  - Vibe Coding Needs Guardrails
  - AI Needs Rituals
  - Structured Flow States in Development
  - TDD as Creative Constraint
  - Perplexity Integration Workflow
- Fixed misspelled file reference with redirect (Vibe Coding Needs Gaurdrails → Guardrails)
- Fixed external link formatting in reference-exclusion-list.md
- Created Media/Pasted Images directory with placeholder images for missing references
- Updated image references in Content Pipeline files to point to correct locations
- Identified double ".md.md" extension issue in Content Pipeline files for future resolution

## 2025-07-19
### Directory Reorganization (19:53)
- Created new directories: `Inbox`, `People`, and `Media` to improve organization
- Moved timestamped notes (202507191634.md, 202507191758.md) to `Fleeting Notes`
- Moved media files (images, recordings) to the new `Media` directory
- Moved template files to the `Templates` directory
- Moved miscellaneous notes to `Inbox` for future triage
- Created missing notes referenced in Home Note:
  - Weekly review note
  - Three fleeting notes on Zettelkasten entry logic, AI notebook strategy, and Obsidian templates
- Updated Home Note to reflect organizational changes
- Enhanced AHS MOC with proper structure and formatting

### Initial Context & Structure (19:28)
- Created the project manifest to capture context, goals, and the current Zettelkasten + AI workflow.
- Documented the directory structure: `Fleeting Notes`, `Permanent Notes`, `Templates`, and supporting folders.
- Confirmed use of Templater scripts for file creation, movement, and metadata insertion.
- Standardized note types: Fleeting, Permanent, Literature, Reference/MOC.
- Metadata fields in use: `Type`, `Created`, `Tags`, and (proposed) `visibility`.
- Promotion flow: Fleeting → Permanent Notes with manual and (future) LLM-assisted triage.
- Privacy and multi-user support flagged as essential for all future development.

### Current State
- No destructive changes made; all notes preserved.
- No existing automation scripts for LLM integration yet—schema and workflow improvements are next.
- YAML/markdown metadata is present in templates and most notes; standardization is ongoing.
- AI/LLM integration points and privacy fields proposed in the manifest, not yet implemented.
