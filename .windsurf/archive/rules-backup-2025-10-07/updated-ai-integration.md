```

### AI Ethics & Transparency
- Augment, Don't Replace: AI enhances human creativity
- Explainable Decisions: Every AI action includes rationale
- User Override: Always allow human correction
- Progressive Disclosure: Simple by default, powerful when needed
- Integration Focus: Leverage existing AI workflows rather than duplicating
- Preserve human decision-making in note promotion
- Maintain metadata consistency in automated processes
- Log AI-assisted actions for transparency
