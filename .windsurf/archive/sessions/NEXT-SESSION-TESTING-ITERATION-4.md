# 🎯 Next Session: TDD Iteration 4 - Test Markers Verification

**Branch**: `feat/testing-week1-tdd-iteration-4-markers-verification`  
**Estimated Duration**: 15-20 minutes  
**Current Branch**: `feat/testing-week1-tdd-iteration-3-integration-migration` (ready to merge or continue)

---

## ✅ TDD Iteration 3 COMPLETED (2025-10-12)

### What We Accomplished
- ✅ **300x Performance Improvement**: 5-10 minutes → 1.35 seconds
- ✅ **Complete Vault Factory Integration**: Eliminated all KNOWLEDGE_DIR references
- ✅ **Test Isolation**: tmp_path per test, zero production vault dependencies
- ✅ **Zero Regressions**: 17 tests passing, 3 skipped (expected)
- ✅ **CI/CD Ready**: Tests work without production vault

### Performance Metrics
```
Before:  5-10 minutes (300+ note production vault)
After:   1.35 seconds (3 note test vault)
Target:  <30 seconds
Achievement: 4.5% of target (exceeded by 22x)
```

### Files Modified/Created
- ✅ `test_dedicated_cli_parity.py` - Migrated to vault factories
- ✅ `test_vault_factory_migration.py` - RED phase requirements (NEW)
- ✅ Lessons learned documentation committed

### Branch Status
- **Current Branch**: `feat/testing-week1-tdd-iteration-3-integration-migration`
- **Commits**: 2 commits (implementation + lessons learned)
- **Status**: Ready to merge or continue on same branch

## 🎯 Next: TDD Iteration 4 - Test Markers Verification

### Goal
Verify 100% test marker coverage and test isolation through random order execution.

### Prerequisites (ALL MET ✅)
- ✅ TDD Iteration 1: Test organization complete
- ✅ TDD Iteration 2: Vault factories ready (0.005s creation)
- ✅ TDD Iteration 3: Integration tests migrated (300x faster)

### Tasks for Iteration 4

#### RED Phase (5 minutes)
Create `test_marker_verification.py` with failing tests:
1. Test that 100% of tests have markers
2. Test that tests pass in random order (no state leakage)
3. Test that @pytest.mark.integration is properly applied
4. Test that @pytest.mark.fast is applied to appropriate tests

#### GREEN Phase (5 minutes)
Verify marker coverage and test isolation:
```bash
# Check marker coverage
pytest --collect-only -m fast
pytest --collect-only -m integration

# Verify test isolation
pip install pytest-random-order
pytest --random-order development/tests/integration/
```

#### REFACTOR Phase (5 minutes)
- Update documentation with marker strategy
- Add marker verification to CI/CD checks
- Document random order testing best practices

#### Expected Results
- ✅ 100% marker coverage verified
- ✅ Tests pass in random order
- ✅ Integration tests properly marked
- ✅ Fast tests properly marked

## 🚀 Quick Start Commands

### Continue on Current Branch
```bash
# Already on feat/testing-week1-tdd-iteration-3-integration-migration
git status  # Verify clean working directory

# Create next iteration test file
touch development/tests/integration/test_marker_verification.py
```

### Or Start Fresh Branch
```bash
git checkout main
git pull origin main
git checkout -b feat/testing-week1-tdd-iteration-4-markers-verification
```

### Verify Current State
```bash
# Run integration tests (should be ~1.35s)
time PYTHONPATH=development pytest development/tests/integration/test_dedicated_cli_parity.py -v

# Check marker coverage
pytest --collect-only -m integration | grep -c "test session starts"
```
