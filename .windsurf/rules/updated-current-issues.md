## 🚨 Current Critical Issues (September 2025)

### ✅ RESOLVED: Template Processing System (2025-09-17)
- File: `knowledge/Inbox/fleeting-20250806-1520-bug-images-dissapear.md.md`
- Issue: `created: {{date:YYYY-MM-DD HH:mm}}` not processing to actual timestamp
- Impact: Previously blocked Reading Intake Pipeline; now unblocked and templates production-ready
- Priority: RESOLVED; verify template health in reviews
- Workflow: Use `/bug-triage-workflow` for systematic resolution

### 🔴 SYSTEM INTEGRITY: Image Linking System
- Issue: Images disappear during AI automation processes
- Impact: Knowledge graph integrity, media asset management compromised
- Areas Affected: AI enhancement, note promotion, template processing
- Investigation: System design issue requiring comprehensive solution

### 📋 Active Projects (September 2025)
- **Smart Link Management**: TDD Iteration 4 complete, production-ready link insertion system
  - Location: Projects/ACTIVE/smart-link-management-system-manifest-v1.md
  - Status: Ready for Phase 5 Bidirectional Link Management
- **Intelligent Tag Management**: Next major AI project for ~300 problematic tags  
  - Location: Projects/ACTIVE/intelligent-tag-management-system-manifest.md
  - Status: 4 TDD iterations planned, builds on existing infrastructure
- **Visual Knowledge Capture**: Mobile workflow requirements analysis complete
  - Location: Projects/ACTIVE/visual-knowledge-capture-manifest.md
  - Status: User requirements documented, 5-10 screenshots/day workflow

### 📁 Project Organization Status (September 2024)
- **Projects Directory**: ✅ CLEANED - 97% reduction in cognitive load (35+ files → 1)
- **ACTIVE/**: 8 current priority projects clearly identified
- **REFERENCE/**: 7 essential documents for quick access
- **COMPLETED-2025-XX/**: 28 items properly archived (15 Sep + 13 Aug)
- **DEPRECATED/**: 10 superseded items providing historical context

## 🎯 Current Development Priorities (September 2025)

### 🔴 CRITICAL (This Week)
1. Image Linking System: Investigate and fix images disappearing during AI automation
2. System Health Check: Ensure all existing tests pass (66/66) before new development

### 🟡 HIGH (Next Week)
3. Intelligent Tag Management Foundation: Begin 4-iteration TDD development
4. Visual Knowledge Capture Planning: Mobile-optimized workflow design  
5. Enhanced Connection Discovery: Implement feedback collection findings

### 🟢 MEDIUM (Phase 6 Preparation)
- User authentication and multi-user foundation
- REST API design for external integrations
- Real-time collaboration features
- Web interface for analytics and management

## 📊 Success Metrics & Validation

### Current Status (September 2025)
- Notes Processed: 212+ notes, 50K+ words
- Test Coverage: 66/66 tests passing (target maintenance)
- AI Adoption: Growing percentage of AI-enhanced notes
- Quality Range: 0.75-0.85 for high-quality content
- Performance: All targets consistently exceeded
- Project Organization: 97% cognitive load reduction achieved

### Major Systems Completed (2025)
- **Smart Link Management**: TDD Iteration 4 complete with link insertion
- **Fleeting Note Lifecycle**: Complete MVP with triage and promotion
- **Directory Organization**: Safety-first P0+P1 system with 17/17 tests passing
- **Enhanced Connection Discovery**: Live data analysis and feedback collection
- **Advanced Tag Enhancement**: 100% suggestion coverage achieved (7.3% → 100%)

### Intelligent Tag Management Targets
- **Coverage**: >90% of 698+ problematic tags receive improvement suggestions
- **Quality**: Transform low-quality tags through AI-powered semantic analysis
- **Performance**: <30 seconds processing for large tag collections
- **Integration**: Seamless connection to existing AI workflows

### Quality Gates
- All tests must pass before deployment
- Performance benchmarks must be met
- User validation required for workflow changes
- Documentation must be updated with every change
- Project organization must maintain cognitive load targets
