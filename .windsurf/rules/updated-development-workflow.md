# Development Workflow & Guidelines

> **Purpose**: TDD methodology, integration guidelines, Git standards  
> **Updated**: 2025-10-05 (Added architectural safeguards)

## üèóÔ∏è Development Guidelines

### Critical Path Management
- Template Processing System: RESOLVED (2025-09-17) - Verify template health in reviews
- Always run system health check before beginning work
- Integration projects must preserve existing functionality
- Phase extensions preferred over standalone replacements
- Project Organization: Maintain clean ACTIVE/REFERENCE/COMPLETED/DEPRECATED structure
- **Architectural Health**: Check class sizes before adding features (see Architectural Constraints)

### TDD Methodology

#### Core Principles
- Red ‚Üí Green ‚Üí Refactor cycles for all new features
- Maintain 66/66 test coverage (current target)
- Real user data validation before production deployment
- Performance benchmarking against established targets
- Integration testing with existing AI workflows
- **Architectural testing**: Prevent god classes through size constraints

#### TDD with Architectural Safeguards

**RED Phase - Architectural Checks**

BEFORE writing failing tests for new features:

**Step 1: Target Class Assessment**
```bash
# Check current size
wc -l development/src/ai/target_class.py

# Check method count
grep -c "^    def " development/src/ai/target_class.py

# Check coupling
grep -r "from.*target_class import" development/ | wc -l
```

**Step 2: Decision Point**

If >400 LOC or >15 methods:
- ‚ùå DO NOT add to existing class
- ‚úÖ Propose extracting utility class FIRST
- ‚úÖ OR propose new manager class
- ‚úÖ Document decision in iteration plan

If <400 LOC and <15 methods:
- ‚úÖ Proceed with feature addition
- üìù Document: "Adding to [ClassName] (current: XXX LOC, XX methods)"

**Step 3: Write Architectural Test**

Always include:
```python
def test_[class]_size_constraint():
    """Prevent god class - fail if too large."""
    from pathlib import Path
    
    source = Path("src/ai/[class].py").read_text()
    loc = len(source.split('\n'))
    methods = source.count('\n    def ')
    
    assert loc < 500, f"[Class] too large: {loc} LOC (max 500)"
    assert methods < 20, f"[Class] too many methods: {methods} (max 20)"
```

**GREEN Phase - Size Monitoring**

AFTER implementing to pass tests:

1. **Re-check class size** (may have grown during implementation)
   ```bash
   wc -l development/src/ai/target_class.py
   ```

2. **If exceeded threshold**:
   - Extract utilities immediately
   - Update tests for new architecture
   - DO NOT commit bloated class

3. **If approaching threshold** (>400 LOC):
   - Add TODO comment: `# TODO: Extract [domain] logic to utility class (approaching 500 LOC limit)`
   - Create refactoring ticket
   - Schedule extraction within 2 iterations

**REFACTOR Phase - Mandatory Architecture Review**

AFTER passing tests, BEFORE committing:

Checklist:
- [ ] Class size within limits (<500 LOC, <20 methods)
- [ ] Single responsibility maintained
- [ ] If >3 helpers added: Extract to utility class
- [ ] If responsibilities mixed: Consider domain separation
- [ ] Architectural tests passing
- [ ] ADR updated if architectural decisions made

**Utility Extraction Pattern**

If added >3 helper methods:

```python
# BEFORE (in main class)
class WorkflowManager:
    def process_note(self):
        result = self._helper1()
        result = self._helper2()
        result = self._helper3()
        return result
    
    def _helper1(self): ...
    def _helper2(self): ...
    def _helper3(self): ...

# AFTER (extracted to utility)
# File: workflow_manager_utils.py
class WorkflowProcessorUtils:
    @staticmethod
    def helper1(): ...
    
    @staticmethod
    def helper2(): ...
    
    @staticmethod
    def helper3(): ...

# File: workflow_manager.py
from .workflow_manager_utils import WorkflowProcessorUtils

class WorkflowManager:
    def process_note(self):
        result = WorkflowProcessorUtils.helper1()
        result = WorkflowProcessorUtils.helper2()
        result = WorkflowProcessorUtils.helper3()
        return result
```

**Post-Iteration Review**

Required questions:

1. **Size**: Is target class within limits?
2. **Responsibility**: Can you state class purpose in <10 words?
3. **Coupling**: Is class imported by <10 files?
4. **Tests**: Do architectural tests pass?
5. **Documentation**: Is ADR updated if needed?

If any answer is NO:
- [ ] Create refactoring ticket
- [ ] Add to architectural review queue
- [ ] Schedule fix within 2 iterations

### Integration-First Development
- Extend vs. Replace: Build on existing Phase 5 AI capabilities
- Schema Compatibility: New metadata fields extend existing ones
- Workflow Preservation: Existing CLI commands must remain functional
- Performance Maintenance: New features cannot degrade existing performance
- Use workflows: `/integration-project-workflow` for Phase extensions

### Code Organization
- CLI Tools: `development/src/cli/` - User-facing commands and demos
- AI Engine: `development/src/ai/` - Core AI processing and workflows
- Tests: `development/tests/` - Comprehensive unit and integration tests
- Templates: `knowledge/Templates/` - Dynamic content generation (Production Ready)
- Project Docs: `Projects/ACTIVE/` - Current manifests and specifications

### Project Lifecycle Integration
- New Projects: Start manifests in Projects/ACTIVE/
- Implementation: All code in development/ with connection to ACTIVE/ manifest
- Completion: Archive lessons learned to Projects/COMPLETED-2025-XX/
- Maintenance: Keep essential docs updated in Projects/REFERENCE/
