## 🚨 Current Critical Issues (August 2025)

### 🔴 BLOCKING BUG: Template Processing Failure
- File: `knowledge/Inbox/fleeting-20250806-1520-bug-images-dissapear.md.md`
- Issue: `created: {{date:YYYY-MM-DD HH:mm}}` not processing to actual timestamp
- Impact: Template automation broken, blocking Reading Intake Pipeline development
- Priority: MUST BE RESOLVED FIRST before any new feature work
- Workflow: Use `/bug-triage-workflow` for systematic resolution

### 🔴 SYSTEM INTEGRITY: Image Linking System
- Issue: Images disappear during AI automation processes
- Impact: Knowledge graph integrity, media asset management compromised
- Areas Affected: AI enhancement, note promotion, template processing
- Investigation: System design issue requiring comprehensive solution

### 📋 Active Project: Reading Intake Pipeline
- Status: Phase 5 extension (not standalone project)
- Dependency: BLOCKED by template processing bug
- Integration: Leverages existing AI workflows (quality scoring, tagging, weekly review)
- Timeline: Sprint 0 (Aug 11-15), MVP (Aug 18), Full System (Aug 29)
- Workflow: Use `/reading-intake-pipeline` and `/integration-project-workflow`

## 🎯 Current Development Priorities (August 2025)

### 🔴 CRITICAL (This Week)
1. Fix Template Processing Bug: Resolve `{{date:YYYY-MM-DD HH:mm}}` processing failure (BLOCKER)
2. Image Linking System: Investigate and fix images disappearing during AI automation
3. System Health Check: Ensure all existing tests pass (66/66) before new development

### 🟡 HIGH (Next Week)
4. Reading Intake Pipeline Foundation: Begin Phase 5 extension development (blocked by #1)
5. Literature Note Templates: Create specialized templates with claims/quotes structure
6. Import Adapter Design: CSV/JSON, bookmarks, Twitter, YouTube, RSS integration

### 🟢 MEDIUM (Phase 6 Preparation)
- User authentication and multi-user foundation
- REST API design for external integrations
- Real-time collaboration features
- Web interface for analytics and management

## 📊 Success Metrics & Validation

### Current Status (August 2025)
- Notes Processed: 212+ notes, 50K+ words
- Test Coverage: 66/66 tests passing (target maintenance)
- AI Adoption: Growing percentage of AI-enhanced notes
- Quality Range: 0.75-0.85 for high-quality content
- Performance: All targets consistently exceeded

### Reading Intake Pipeline Targets
- Performance: <30 seconds per item triage
- Quality: 70% Literature notes have 2+ links + 1 claim
- Productivity: 5+ Permanent notes promoted per week
- Error Rate: <1% on importer jobs

### Quality Gates
- All tests must pass before deployment
- Performance benchmarks must be met
- User validation required for workflow changes
- Documentation must be updated with every change
- Template processing must be functional before new features
