# Contributing to InnerOS Zettelkasten

Thank you for your interest in contributing! This document provides guidelines and best practices for contributing to this project.

## üéØ Quick Start

1. **Fork & Clone**: Fork the repo and clone your fork
2. **Set up Environment**: Run setup commands (see below)
3. **Create Branch**: Use descriptive branch names
4. **Make Changes**: Follow our coding standards
5. **Test**: Ensure all tests pass
6. **Submit PR**: Use our PR template

## üõ†Ô∏è Development Setup

### Prerequisites
- Python 3.11+ (3.13 recommended)
- Git
- GitHub account

### Initial Setup

```bash
# Clone your fork
git clone https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/inneros-zettelkasten.git
cd inneros-zettelkasten

# Create virtual environment
cd development
python3 -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows: venv\Scripts\activate

# Install dependencies
pip install --upgrade pip
pip install -r ../requirements.txt
pip install ruff black pyright pytest pytest-cov

# Verify setup
cd ..
make test  # Should pass all checks
```

## üìã Development Workflow

### 1. Create a Branch

Use descriptive branch names following these patterns:

- `feat/feature-name` - New features
- `fix/bug-description` - Bug fixes
- `docs/what-changed` - Documentation updates
- `chore/task-description` - Maintenance tasks
- `test/what-testing` - Test additions/fixes

### 2. Follow TDD Methodology

We use Test-Driven Development (TDD). See `.windsurf/rules/updated-development-workflow.md` for detailed guidance.

**TDD Cycle**:
1. **RED**: Write failing tests first
2. **GREEN**: Implement minimal code to pass
3. **REFACTOR**: Improve code quality
4. **COMMIT**: Document changes
5. **LESSONS**: Record insights

### 3. Code Quality Standards

#### Linting & Formatting
```bash
make lint   # Run ruff + black checks
make type   # Run pyright type checking
```

All code must pass:
- **ruff**: Linting (E, F, W rules)
- **black**: Code formatting
- **pyright**: Type checking (optional but encouraged)

#### Testing
```bash
make unit   # Run unit tests
make cov    # Run with coverage report
```

Requirements:
- All new features must have tests
- Maintain or improve coverage
- Tests must be fast (<5s per test file)

### 4. Commit Messages

Follow conventional commits:

```
type(scope): description

[optional body]

[optional footer]
```

**Types**:
- `feat`: New feature
- `fix`: Bug fix
- `docs`: Documentation
- `test`: Test changes
- `chore`: Maintenance
- `refactor`: Code restructuring

**Example**:
```
feat(workflow): Add orphaned note detection

- Implement bidirectional link graph analysis
- Add detection for notes with zero connections  
- Include CLI integration with export options

Closes #42
```

## üß™ Testing Guidelines

### Writing Tests

```python
"""
Test module docstring explaining what's being tested.
"""

def test_feature_does_something_specific():
    """Test that feature behaves correctly in normal case."""
    # Arrange
    input_data = create_test_data()
    
    # Act
    result = feature_under_test(input_data)
    
    # Assert
    assert result == expected_output
```

### Test Organization
- Unit tests in `development/tests/unit/`
- Integration tests in `development/tests/integration/`
- Use descriptive test names
- One assertion per test when possible
- Mock external dependencies

## üèóÔ∏è Architecture Guidelines

### File Organization

```
development/
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ src/

```

### Code Style

- **Functions**: Snake_case, descriptive names
- **Classes**: PascalCase
