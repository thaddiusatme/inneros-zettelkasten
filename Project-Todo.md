  - [ ] **Scheduled Jobs**: Automated daily/weekly AI processing ‚è≥ Next step

- [ ] **Workflow Integration**
  - [ ] **Inbox Processing**: Auto-tag new notes in Inbox/
  - [ ] **Connection Discovery**: Find related notes and suggest links
  - [ ] **Quality Checks**: Validate note structure and completeness
  - [ ] **Archive Management**: Intelligent cleanup and organization

### Phase 5.3: Advanced Features ‚úÖ IN PROGRESS 2025-07-27

- [x] **Note Processing Pipeline** ‚úÖ COMPLETED
  - [x] Context-aware tag generation via Ollama API
  - [x] Automated inbox processing with file watching
  - [x] Batch re-tagging of existing notes
  - [x] CLI tools for manual operations

- [ ] **Note Summarization** ‚è≥ NEXT PRIORITY
  - [ ] Create summary generation for long notes (>500 words)
  - [ ] Implement extractive summarization for literature notes
  - [ ] Add summary storage and retrieval system
  - [ ] Create summary display in note preview

- [ ] **Connection Discovery** ‚è≥ NEXT PRIORITY
  - [ ] Build semantic similarity search between notes
  - [ ] Create "related notes" suggestions
  - [ ] Implement link prediction based on content
  - [ ] Add visual connection mapping
