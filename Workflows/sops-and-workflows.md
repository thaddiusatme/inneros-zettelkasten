# 📋 SOPs & Workflows

A living collection of repeatable processes for MOC review, orphaned note management, and more.

## 🧠 MOC Review Workflow (Weekly)
- [ ] Review Home Note for broken/missing links and update/create stubs as needed.
- [ ] Visit each MOC (Projects, Concepts, Books, AHS) and add/remove links for new or completed items.
- [ ] Pin your “Today’s Focus” in Home Note to guide your week.
- [ ] Check the “Fleeting Note Review Queue” for notes ready for promotion.

_Tip: Set a recurring reminder (e.g., every Sunday) to run this checklist._

## 🗂️ Orphaned Note Review Workflow
- [ ] Open `broken links output.md` and review the list of orphaned or broken-linked notes.
- [ ] For each orphaned note:
    - [ ] Decide: Promote, link from a MOC, archive, or delete.
    - [ ] If promoting, add it to the appropriate MOC and update its metadata.
    - [ ] If linking, ensure it’s referenced from at least one MOC or relevant note.
    - [ ] If archiving, move to an “Archive” folder or tag as archived.
- [ ] Update Home Note’s “Orphaned Notes” section as you resolve items.

_Tip: Do this as part of your weekly review, or whenever you notice navigation friction._

## 🤖 Automation/Audit Flow (Optional)
- Use AI prompts in your Home Note to auto-suggest links for orphaned notes or summarize untriaged fleeting notes.
- Periodically run or update your broken links report to keep hygiene high.
