# Project Manifest — Morning Block (Sun Aug 24, 2025)

**Scope:** 2 pomodoros total, light creative push  
**Theme:** Content foundations — shot list + polishing

---

## 🎯 Goals
- Finalize content shot list (0.5 pomodoro)  
- Polish 2 Veronica GPT posts (1 pomodoro)

## ✅ Definition of Done
- Shot list is ready for review (no open questions)  
- Both Veronica GPT posts are cleaned, structured, and publish-ready

## ⏱️ Time Budget
- Morning pre-lunch block  
- Max 90 minutes focus (breaks included)

## 📋 Tasks
1. Review draft shot list  
   - Remove duplicates, clarify locations  
   - Add 2–3 camera setting notes  
2. Finalize shot list into single doc  
3. Open Veronica GPT drafts  
   - Smooth intros and closes  
   - Ensure CTA is aligned  
   - Quick grammar + formatting check  

## 🪜 Risks
- Spending too much time on camera details → cap at 0.5 pomodoro  
- Polishing scope creep → only 2 posts, save extras for tomorrow
