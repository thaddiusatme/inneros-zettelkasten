# Project Manifest — Afternoon Block (Sun Aug 24, 2025)

**Scope:** 1 pomodoro only, capped  
**Theme:** Skeleton building, not detail filling

---

## 🎯 Goals
- Develop content calendar skeleton

## ✅ Definition of Done
- A 30-day grid or outline exists  
- Includes content pillars, post frequency, and placeholders  
- Not populated with finished posts (just structure)

## ⏱️ Time Budget
- Early afternoon, before park/dogs break  
- 45 minutes max

## 📋 Tasks
1. Open blank doc/sheet  
2. Lay out 30 slots (rows or boxes)  
3. Add 3 pillar headers (simplification, education, roots/realness)  
4. Distribute slots roughly across pillars  
5. Save + mark draft complete  

## 🪜 Risks
- Calendar fills into actual posts → mitigate by only labeling slots  
- Running over → hard stop at 45 minutes
