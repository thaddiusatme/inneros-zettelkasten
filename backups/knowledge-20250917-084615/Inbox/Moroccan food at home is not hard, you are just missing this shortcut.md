**Thread 1**

- **Opening Hook:** Moroccan food looks complicated, but the secret is one shortcut ingredient that transforms your kitchen into Marrakech in minutes.
    
- **Individual Steps:**
    

1. Stock Ras el Hanout: Morocco’s “everything spice blend” that replaces 10+ spices.
    
2. Add preserved lemons: The instant way to get authentic tangy depth.
    
3. Use harissa paste: One spoon turns a basic stew into Moroccan magic.
    
4. Swap couscous for quick-cook versions: Cuts prep time to 5 minutes.
    
5. Finish with fresh herbs: Parsley and cilantro bring restaurant-level freshness.
    
6. Combine just these and any meat or veggie = Moroccan in under 30 minutes.

**Thread 2**

- **Opening Hook:** Stop scrolling Moroccan recipes like they’re impossible. Here’s how to fake “grandma-level” flavor with one simple kitchen hack.
    
- **Individual Steps:**
    

1. Buy one jar of preserved lemons (the soul of Moroccan cooking).
    
2. Use the rind, not the pulp, for that authentic burst of citrus.
    
3. Mix it into chicken, tagines, or even salad dressings.
    
4. Pair with Ras el Hanout and suddenly you’re cooking like Fez street vendors.
    
5. No tagine pot? A Dutch oven works just fine.
    
6. Your guests will never know you cheated.
