- **Opening Hook:** The fastest path to Moroccan flavor is learning to handle spices like a local.
    
- **Individual Steps:**

    2. Bloom ground spices in oil with onions to unlock aroma without burning.
        
    3. Color equals flavor: paprika and turmeric should tint the oil before liquids go in.
        
    4. Use saffron smartly: soak a pinch in hot water, add the liquid late for aroma.
        
    5. Sweet meets savory: add chopped apricots or dates in the last 10 minutes for gentle sweetness.
        
    6. Preserved lemon rule: use the peel for brightness, rinse if too salty, slice thin.
        
    7. Olives go near the end so they stay meaty and vibrant.
        
    8. Adjust at the finish: lemon juice for lift, salt for clarity, parsley and cilantro for freshness.
