**Thread 1**

- **Opening Hook:** Your harissa tastes flat because you’re making these rookie mistakes. Fix them, and it’ll taste like fire and silk at the same time.
    
- **Individual Steps:**
    

1. You’re not toasting your spices. Toasted cumin and caraway release oils that bring depth.
    
2. You’re skipping fresh chili. Dried chilies alone give heat but no brightness.
    
3. You’re using cheap olive oil. A pepper paste needs quality fat to carry flavor.
    
4. You’re forgetting acidity. A splash of lemon juice or vinegar makes flavors pop.
    
5. You’re blending too smooth. Harissa should have texture, not baby food consistency.

**Thread 4**

- **Opening Hook:** Want harissa that hits like Tunisian street food? Here are the secrets chefs don’t tell you.
    
- **Individual Steps:**
    

1. Soak chilies in hot water _and_ a splash of vinegar, not just water.
    
2. Grind spices right before blending—pre-ground loses punch.
    
3. Add preserved lemon peel for authentic tang.
    
4. Keep some chili seeds in for bitterness that adds complexity.
    
5. Store it overnight—the flavors deepen after resting.
