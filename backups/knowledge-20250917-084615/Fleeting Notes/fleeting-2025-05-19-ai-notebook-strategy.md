# AI Notebook Strategy

Quick thoughts on integrating AI more effectively into my note-taking workflow.

## Ideas

- Create templater scripts that can call AI for auto-tagging
- Consider different AI models for different note types
- Explore ways to use AI for connecting ideas acrnoss notes

## Potential Tools
- Obsidian Copilot plugin
- Local LLM setup (Ollama?)
- Custom GPTs for specific note processing tasks

## Questions
- How to maintain privacy while leveraging AI?
- What's the right balance of manual vs. AI-assisted linking?
- How to preserve the serendipity of manual connections?

## Next Steps
- [ ] Research local LLM options
- [ ] Draft AI prompt templates for different note processing tasks
- [ ] Test AI-assisted tagging on a sample of notes
