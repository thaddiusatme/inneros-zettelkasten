# Digital Minimalism with AI

How can we use AI to minimize our life?

## Core Insight
AI should reduce complexity, not add it. The goal is "calm urgency" - strategic automation that creates space for what matters most.

## Minimalism Applications
- **Decision Reduction**: AI handles routine choices (content scheduling, email triage)
- **Cognitive Load**: Automate repetitive mental tasks (research, summarization)
- **Time Reclamation**: AI creates space for deep work and human connection
- **Attention Protection**: Curated information flows vs. infinite scroll
