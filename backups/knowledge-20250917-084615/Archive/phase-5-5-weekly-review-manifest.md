# Phase 5.5: Weekly Review Automation Manifest

## 🎯 Sprint Objective
Complete the AI-enhanced workflow management cycle by implementing an automated **Weekly Review Checklist Command** that eliminates manual inbox aggregation and provides AI-powered promotion recommendations in a structured, actionable format.

## 🏗️ Architecture Overview

### Core Component: Weekly Review System
```
WorkflowManager (existing) + Weekly Review Extension
├── Inbox Scanner: Aggregates all unprocessed notes
├── AI Recommender: Leverages existing quality assessment 
├── Checklist Generator: Formats actionable review items
└── Export Engine: Saves reports for tracking
```

### Integration Points
- **Extends**: `src/ai/workflow_manager.py` - WorkflowManager class
- **CLI Entry**: `src/cli/workflow_demo.py` - Add `--weekly-review` flag
- **Dependencies**: Phase 5.4 analytics, Phase 5.3 AI features
- **Output**: Structured markdown checklists + JSON metadata

## 📋 Feature Specifications

### 1. Aggregate Inbox Notes Scanner
**Purpose**: Automatically discover all notes requiring review attention
- **Primary Source**: All `.md` files in `Inbox/` directory  
- **Secondary Source**: Files in `Fleeting Notes/` with `status: inbox` in YAML frontmatter
- **Edge Cases**: Handle missing YAML, malformed files, empty content
- **Performance**: <5 seconds for 200+ note collections

### 2. AI-Powered Promotion Recommendations  
**Purpose**: Leverage existing AI quality assessment to guide promotion decisions
- **Quality Thresholds**:
  - `>0.7`: **Promote to Permanent** (high-quality, comprehensive content)
  - `>0.4`: **Further Develop** (keep as fleeting, needs refinement)
  - `<0.4`: **Needs Improvement** (revise significantly or archive)
- **Rationale**: Include AI-generated reasoning and confidence scores
- **Reuse**: Existing `WorkflowManager.process_inbox_note()` logic

### 3. Checklist-Style Output Format
**Purpose**: Transform analysis into actionable weekly review tasks
```markdown
# Weekly Review - 2025-07-30
**Summary**: 8 notes to process (3 promote, 3 refine, 2 improve)

  - Quality: 0.30/1.0 | AI suggests: too brief, unclear purpose
```

### 4. CLI Integration & User Experience
**Purpose**: Seamless integration into existing workflow tools
- **Primary Command**: `python3 src/cli/workflow_demo.py . --weekly-review`
- **Interactive Mode**: `--weekly-review --interactive` for guided processing
- **Export Option**: `--export-checklist weekly-review-2025-07-30.md`
- **Dry Run**: `--weekly-review --dry-run` for safe preview
- **JSON Output**: `--weekly-review --format json` for automation

## 🚀 Implementation Plan

### Phase 5.5.1: Core Scanner Implementation (Week 1)
- [ ] **Method**: `WorkflowManager.scan_review_candidates()`
- [ ] **Logic**: Combine inbox + fleeting notes with `status: inbox`
- [ ] **Error Handling**: Graceful failures for malformed files
- [ ] **Testing**: Unit tests with mock note collections

### Phase 5.5.2: AI Recommendation Engine (Week 1-2)  
- [ ] **Method**: `WorkflowManager.generate_weekly_recommendations()`
- [ ] **Reuse**: Existing `process_inbox_note()` quality assessment
- [ ] **Enhancement**: Add confidence scoring and detailed rationale
- [ ] **Testing**: Integration tests with real note samples

### Phase 5.5.3: Checklist Generator & CLI (Week 2)
- [ ] **Method**: `WorkflowManager.format_weekly_checklist()`
- [ ] **CLI**: Extend `workflow_demo.py` argument parser
- [ ] **Export**: Markdown and JSON format options
- [ ] **Testing**: End-to-end CLI testing with sample data

### Phase 5.5.4: Enhanced Features (Week 3)
- [ ] **Orphaned Notes**: Detect notes with no links
- [ ] **Stale Notes**: Flag notes not updated in 30+ days  
- [ ] **Draft Promotion**: Include `Permanent Notes/` with `status: draft`
- [ ] **Metrics**: Track review completion and success rates
