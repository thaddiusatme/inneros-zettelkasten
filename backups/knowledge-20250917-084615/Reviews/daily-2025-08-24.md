## 🎯 Tomorrow’s Focus Preview
- Main focus block(s) to protect  
- Top 2–3 things that need momentum  

---

## 🎯 Core Product Goals in Play

- **Freelance Portfolio**: Start collecting, curating, and lightly formatting past work into assets you can show (case studies, outlines, campaigns).
    
- **Mustapha 30-Day Campaign**: Week 1 assets need to be shipped → high visibility, directly tied to revenue and portfolio.
    
- **Content System Foundations**: Calendar skeleton leads into actual populated posts + shot list leads into footage for ongoing content.
    

---

## ✅ Scrum Goals for Tomorrow

### 1. Mustapha Campaign

- Finalize **Week 1 post drafts** (4 posts + 1 template were scoped).
    
- Confirm **deliverables + due dates** with Mustapha so expectations are locked.
    
- Open **tracking sheet w/UTM links** to start baseline metrics.
    

### 2. Portfolio Building

- Select **2 past deliverables** (sales page, campaign outline, SOP, etc.) and frame them as “case studies” (what problem, what process, what outcome).
    
- Set up a **Portfolio folder structure** (Work → Case Studies → Drafts).
    

### 3. Content System Next Step

- Take today’s **calendar skeleton** and populate **5–7 placeholder topics** under pillars. Don’t overfill — just enough to test flow.
    
- Cross-check **Veronica GPT post style** → lock tone so new posts align.
    

---

## ⏱ Suggested Focus Blocks (Mon Aug 25)

- **Morning Deep Work (90m)** → Mustapha posts + tracking sheet setup.
    
- **Late Morning (45m)** → Portfolio: format 1 case study draft.
    
- **Afternoon (60m)** → Content calendar population + Veronica GPT alignment.
    
- **Admin (15m)** → Quick sync (email/check-ins) + file organization.
    

---

## ⚠ Watch Outs

- Don’t let portfolio work eat the morning → protect Mustapha work as the revenue driver.
    
- Portfolio can be framed _lightly_ (bullet case studies at first) → avoid perfectionism.
    
- Calendar should still stay lean → placeholders, not polished posts.

Do you want me to **draft your Mon Aug 25 Daily Standup note** now (like we did today), preloaded with these tasks, so you start the morning ready?
