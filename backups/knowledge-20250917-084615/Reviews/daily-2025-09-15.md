# Daily Note — 2025-09-15

Here’s your Scrum note for today, kept tight and in the structure we’ve been using:

# Daily Note — 2025-09-15

## Focus

- Grounding and recovery after trigger.
- Keep Sprint 3 funnel goal visible without pressure.
    

## Standup

- **Yesterday:** WFM shift, confirmation email progress.
- **Today:** WFM shift done, no funnel progress (trigger + recovery).
- **Blockers:** Emotional state + focus.
    

## Wins

- Protected boundaries at WFM.
- Recognized the need to pause instead of forcing work.
    

## Next

- Tomorrow morning before WFM: test checkout + confirm email trigger.
- Quick room reset to clear space.
- Light evening distribution draft (1–2 posts).
    

## EOD Micro Retro

- **What moved the needle:** Self-awareness, not forcing tasks.
- **What felt hard:** Shaking the encounter + regaining focus.
- **What to change tomorrow:** Use the morning window for one key funnel task before WFM.
