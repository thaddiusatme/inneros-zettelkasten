# Daily Note — 2025-08-23

### Focus
**Sales Page + Social Media Foundations**
### Standup
- **Yesterday (Aug 22):** Planned to prioritize sales page and content sprint.
- **Blockers:** Energy dip after shift slowed progress.
### What Shipped (Aug 23)
- Created **Mustapha’s Social Media Outline**.
- Built **Veronica GPT post drafts**.
- **Finalized sales page** with copy + testimonials.
- **Scheduled 2 posts** for sales page promotion.
- Drafted **shot list** for content.
- Completed **weekly review for Inner OS app**.
- Advanced **vibe coding on Inner OS**.
### Next (for Aug 24, rolling over)
-  Review + expand **Mustapha’s Social Media Outline** — 30m.
	-  Expand **Veronica GPT post drafts** into publish-ready posts — 45m.
-  Review/refine **shot list** for content — 20m.
-  Continue **Inner OS app vibe coding** with 1 feature slice — 45m. (optional)
## EOD Micro Retro
- What moved the needle:
	- Finalizing the **sales page** with testimonials + scheduling posts; creating **Mustapha’s outline** and **Veronica GPT posts** gave you reusable systems.
- What felt hard:
	- Keeping momentum across multiple fronts — context switching between sales page, social posts, and Inner OS coding.
- What to change tomorrow:
	- Tighten scope → finish **shot list review** and publish-ready posts before opening new tasks.
**Momentum Summary:** You shipped a big package today — sales page live, content system foundations, plus progress on Inner OS. 

Tomorrow is about trimming scope to reinforce what’s already built.
