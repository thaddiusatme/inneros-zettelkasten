# Daily Note — 2025-09-13 (updated)

## Focus

- Protect maker energy after WFM shift
- Prep environment for tomorrow’s maker day
- Incremental funnel progress: keep email + automation momentum
- Align with Mustapha at 4:30
## Today Board (Sat 9/13)

**Must Do**
- WFM shift 6:00a–2:00p
- Quick reset (food, decompress)
- Meeting with Mustapha 4:30p (social campaign alignment + next steps)

**Should Do**
- Capture notes on confirmation email progress
- Sketch next step for automation skeleton (checkout trigger → tag)

**Could Do**
- Room 15-min reset
- Draft 1–2 social posts (baseline, light lift)

## Blocker
- Sprint 3 acceptance criteria still pending: test checkout + analytics validation
- Energy recovery after shift limits deep work
## Wins Carryover
- Confirmation email copy drafted yesterday
- Mustapha deliverable already shipped this week
- Newsletter cadence on track
    

## EOD Micro Retro
- What moved the needle: Talking to Mustapha, we got a commission deal for every bottle I sell
- What felt hard: talking to Mustapha, but also staying away from work
- What to change tomorrow: Watch demon slayer and perform my 2 week retro.
