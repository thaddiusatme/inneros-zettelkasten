# Daily Note — 2025-09-11

# 📌 Today Board (Thu 9/11)

**Must Do (non-negotiable)**

- Mustapha’s Social Campaign → promised deliverable, must be ready to show.
    
- Landing Page draft (structure + copy outline live).
    

**Should Do (important, next layer)**

- Gym → energy management.
    
- Quick check-in with Brit if any tickets are pending.
    

**Could Do (flex if energy/time left)**

- Clean Room (personal backlog).
    
- Sketch 2 draft posts for Social Content baseline.

# 🗓 Next 3-Day Plan

### **Fri 9/12 (WFM shift 6a–12:30p)**

- **Before work (if possible):** Quick funnel touch (confirmation email draft).
- **After work:** Battery errand (knock it out so it doesn’t clog mental space).
- **Light evening task:** Social Content draft batch (2–3 posts).
    

---

### **Sat 9/13 (WFM shift 6a–2p)**

- **Afternoon block:** Checkout Setup (critical milestone).
- **Evening:** Test transaction attempt (prep for analytics validation).
- **Optional:** Personal task (room clean or eBay listings).
    

---

### **Sun 9/14 (last sprint day)**

- **Morning/early afternoon:**
    - Analytics validation (pixels/events firing).
    - Bio link update (Threads, IG, FB, site).
- **Late afternoon:** Publish/schedule 1-week Social Content baseline.
- **Evening:** Sprint wrap check → at least 1 test checkout logged.
---

This flow keeps
- **Today** = Mustapha + Landing Page (your two “keystones”).
- **Fri** = Light (errand + content), since WFM eats half the day
- **Sat** = Checkout + test run.
- **Sun** = Validation + distribution, close sprint strong.
