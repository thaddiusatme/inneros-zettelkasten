# Daily Note â€” 2025-08-31

## Focus

- Close Sprint 2 with a clean retro and prep Sprint 3
- Stabilize the editorial base for newsletter and Threads
- Ship Brit maintenance tasks queued for evening window
    

## Standup

- Yesterday:
    - Reviewed data schema and Project Manifest v3.0
    - Built initial separate tables for newsletter and Threads inside the editorial base
    - Mapped Link in Bio funnel and tripwire paths at a high level  
- Today:
    - Finish editorial table fixes and field naming
        
    - Set up Airtable automation to create child records when Approval is checked
        
    - Draft ThreadWeavers hub copy and section list
        
    - Queue Brit maintenance items for after-hours execution
        
- Blockers:
    
    - Uncertainty on final newsletter schema fields vs what should live in Master Editorial
        
    - Decision needed on free demo placement vs newsletter opt-in on hub

## Wins

- Editorial base now supports generating platform specific records from a single source
    
- Clearer tripwire path with upsell ladder placeholders
    
- Momentum regained after earlier burnout dip
    

## Next

1. Implement Approval trigger to create rows in Threads and Newsletter tables with back links
    
2. Write hub hero, value bullets, and primary CTA for ThreadWeavers
    
3. Prepare Brit maintenance checklist and runbook for tonight
    

## Journal

- Feeling more organized after aligning schema with manifest

## EOD Micro Retro

- What moved the needle: Aligning schema and setting concrete automations to reduce manual steps

- What to change tomorrow: Lock newsletter field list first, then wire automations to avoid rework
