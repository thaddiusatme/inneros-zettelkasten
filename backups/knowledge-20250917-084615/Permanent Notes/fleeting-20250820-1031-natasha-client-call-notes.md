### Summary

Thaddius Cho and n s discussed n s's challenges with their social media team, who face language barriers and a lack of scientific background, leading to inaccurate and clichéd content for their nutritional supplement business. n s sought an AI solution to create genuine, automated text content for platforms like Threads, inspired by Thaddius's AI assistance for Terry Smart's Instagram posts, aiming to increase reach and quality while maintaining direct engagement. Thaddius proposed collaboration options, including a workflow audit, a training workshop for n s's team, or direct system building, outlining pricing ranging from $200 for an audit to $1,000-$10,000 for a complete system, and shared their background in social media and AI.

### Details

- Initial Introductions and Background Thaddius Cho and n s started the meeting by clarifying the confusion around the meeting time and then shared personal details, including their locations and experiences with weather conditions. n s mentioned being in Orlando and having recently experienced a severe thunderstorm, which they clarified was not hurricane level but still involved significant lightning, thunder, wind, rain, and power outages ([00:00:00](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1bxZQ0Pe8KvSpCJzodjKWwdvaITJt5mHfa_E2A96VX2g/edit?tab=t.bx7y3pojh30g#heading=h.iwxws7dgny7v)). Thaddius, based in Seattle, contrasted their rain experience, noting that it drizzles for months rather than pouring. They also discussed the pronunciation of their names, with n s clarifying that their last name is "Stanchlesu," which most people do not attempt to pronounce, and Thaddius sharing a similar experience with their Korean name ([00:32:52](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1bxZQ0Pe8KvSpCJzodjKWwdvaITJt5mHfa_E2A96VX2g/edit?tab=t.bx7y3pojh30g#heading=h.rh3yhew6qjw9)).
    
- Business and Social Media Challenges Thaddius Cho noted from n s's profile that they are involved in manufacturing and selling nutritional supplements and have an Instagram page for their dog. They then addressed n s's current challenges with their social media team, who are based in the U.S. but are originally from Brazil, leading to language barriers and a lack of scientific background for the content ([00:34:04](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1bxZQ0Pe8KvSpCJzodjKWwdvaITJt5mHfa_E2A96VX2g/edit?tab=t.bx7y3pojh30g#heading=h.qdr1e5bmfi0)). n s confirmed these issues, explaining that inaccuracies occur in translations, such as "skin off" instead of "sick often," and that their team often uses clichéd phrases like "radical transparency" and "science-backed" that do not align with their brand's voice ([00:35:24](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1bxZQ0Pe8KvSpCJzodjKWwdvaITJt5mHfa_E2A96VX2g/edit?tab=t.bx7y3pojh30g#heading=h.ymddm5qepyvw)) ([00:38:04](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1bxZQ0Pe8KvSpCJzodjKWwdvaITJt5mHfa_E2A96VX2g/edit?tab=t.bx7y3pojh30g#heading=h.l01n3pmj93v8)). n s also expressed a desire to inspire other women, particularly as a BIPOC, autistic, and perimenopausal individual, and felt their current content did not go deep enough to achieve this ([00:42:39](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1bxZQ0Pe8KvSpCJzodjKWwdvaITJt5mHfa_E2A96VX2g/edit?tab=t.bx7y3pojh30g#heading=h.54k23zsd3f6m)).
    
- AI Solution and Desired Outcomes n s explained that they reached out to Thaddius Cho after learning from Terry Smart that their engaging Instagram posts were generated with AI assistance ([00:35:24](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1bxZQ0Pe8KvSpCJzodjKWwdvaITJt5mHfa_E2A96VX2g/edit?tab=t.bx7y3pojh30g#heading=h.ymddm5qepyvw)). Thaddius confirmed they had taught Terry how to use AI to build their brand voice for text-only platforms like Threads ([00:36:47](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1bxZQ0Pe8KvSpCJzodjKWwdvaITJt5mHfa_E2A96VX2g/edit?tab=t.bx7y3pojh30g#heading=h.p0h7vjl7jgox)). Thaddius explained that their method involves fine-tuning AI tools like ChatGPT or Claude to understand the user's personality and target audience, thereby avoiding generic outputs ([00:38:04](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1bxZQ0Pe8KvSpCJzodjKWwdvaITJt5mHfa_E2A96VX2g/edit?tab=t.bx7y3pojh30g#heading=h.l01n3pmj93v8)). n s articulated their goal of creating an automated system that is genuine and authentic to them, can generate text content for platforms like Threads, and allows them to increase their reach and improve social media quality without being completely hands-off. They emphasized wanting to engage with people directly, with AI starting conversations rather than replacing them ([00:44:20](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1bxZQ0Pe8KvSpCJzodjKWwdvaITJt5mHfa_E2A96VX2g/edit?tab=t.bx7y3pojh30g#heading=h.gauv02ibnldk)).
    
- Proposed Collaboration and Pricing Thaddius Cho proposed several ways to collaborate, including a workflow audit to identify automation opportunities, a training workshop for n s's team if they are open to learning AI tools, or direct collaboration with n s to build these systems where n s would be the approver ([00:45:44](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1bxZQ0Pe8KvSpCJzodjKWwdvaITJt5mHfa_E2A96VX2g/edit?tab=t.bx7y3pojh30g#heading=h.o3ejn0tgxbij)). Thaddius explained that these options scale differently in terms of complexity and time commitment ([00:46:50](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1bxZQ0Pe8KvSpCJzodjKWwdvaITJt5mHfa_E2A96VX2g/edit?tab=t.bx7y3pojh30g#heading=h.4p5u5y39pbun)). Thaddius then outlined the pricing for their services: audits are around $200, a two-day workshop for the team is approximately $500, and building out a complete system could range from $1,000 to $10,000, depending on the scope and discovery required ([00:48:50](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1bxZQ0Pe8KvSpCJzodjKWwdvaITJt5mHfa_E2A96VX2g/edit?tab=t.bx7y3pojh30g#heading=h.h4nc8v45z5nt)). Thaddius also briefly shared their background, mentioning their experience running social media campaigns for a ginger ginseng supplement called Origin, which was once number one on Amazon, and their subsequent transition into AI ([00:49:48](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1bxZQ0Pe8KvSpCJzodjKWwdvaITJt5mHfa_E2A96VX2g/edit?tab=t.bx7y3pojh30g#heading=h.ev0l0lacdxdc)).
