## Core Idea
AI-assisted note-taking during the capture phase could revolutionize knowledge management by providing real-time context enrichment, automatic tagging, and connection discovery as ideas are being recorded.

## Why It Matters
Traditional note-taking captures raw thoughts but leaves processing for later. AI assistance during capture could:
- Reduce cognitive load during idea recording
- Improve note quality through immediate context addition
- Accelerate knowledge graph building through automatic linking
- Enable better tag suggestions based on content analysis

## Implementation Considerations
- **Privacy**: AI processing during capture raises data privacy concerns
- **Integration Points**: Need to identify where AI can assist without disrupting flow
- **Real-time Performance**: AI assistance must be fast enough not to interrupt thinking
- **User Control**: Balance automation with user agency over their notes

## Links
- Related to current InnerOS workflow development
- Connects to broader automation and LLM integration goals
- Could inform future template and Templater script enhancements

## Next Actions
- Research existing AI note-taking tools and their approaches
- Design integration points for LLM assistance during capture
- Prototype smart tagging suggestions
- Evaluate privacy implications and mitigation strategies
