## Thought  
Despite mandates and productivty gains, the workforce is hesitant to comply. Some also question whether information can be actually trusted at that level. 

This strike in the chain for humanity is that we are further training our jobs away from automation. 

i remember when i was saying, my main goal is to automate my job away.

Althought automation is going to bring a positve net+, we are seeing hesitancy and many 'anti ai' talk
