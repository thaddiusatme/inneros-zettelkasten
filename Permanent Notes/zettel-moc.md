## Thought
- Fleeting MOCs can help us link fleeting notes that need to be addressed 
- Use this for anytime we are overwhemled

## Context (Optional)
- This is important for maitencence 
- Folder still have a place, but not great for creating a idea garden and binary
- Tags require too much context that we shouldnt nede to hold
