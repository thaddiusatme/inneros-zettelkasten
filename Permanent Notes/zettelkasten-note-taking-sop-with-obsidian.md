## 
## I. Foundational Setup & Principles

### 1. Define Your "Why"

- **Identify your interests**: Focus on capturing "Your Everything" - what's relevant to you and sparks your interests
- **Establish "Life Cues" or "Big Qs"**: Define fundamental questions that guide your interests and projects
- **Purpose**: Support research, memory recording, and ambitious content creation

### 2. Obsidian Vault Setup

- **Create one central vault**: Establish a single folder on your hard drive as your knowledge base home
- **Rationale**: Maintain data control with future-proof text file format
- **Benefit**: Access your data even if the app becomes unavailable

### 3. Daily Habits Foundation

- **Enable "Daily Notes" plugin**: Your primary capture location for ideas, findings, and journal entries
- **Source tracking habit**: Always note where thoughts originated (sources or previous note links)
- **Consistency**: Make note-taking a daily practice to track thought evolution and identify recurring themes

## II. The 5-Step Zettelkasten Workflow

### Step 1: Fleeting Notes (Quick Capture)

**Purpose**: Temporary notes for immediate thought capture

**Process**:

- Use your Obsidian daily note as the primary location
- Treat as temporary to-dos that will be processed or deleted later
- Don't spend excessive time formatting or organizing

**Guidelines**:

- Quick capture only - raw thoughts and ideas
- Temporary by nature - process within 24-48 hours

### Step 2: Reference Notes (External Information)

**Purpose**: Capture direct quotes and highlights from external sources

**Process**:

- Import highlights using tools like Readwise, Zotero, or manual input
- Store in dedicated folder (e.g., "Readwise folder")
- Include only direct quotes - no personal interpretation
- Link to exact source location (chapter, page, timestamp)

**Guidelines**:

- Don't be overly selective when highlighting - capture freely
- Keep reference notes completely separate from your interpretations
- Focus on preserving the original author's exact words

### Step 3: Literature Notes (Your Interpretation)

**Purpose**: Process reference notes into your own understanding and takeaways

**Process**:

- Create new note in Obsidian for each source
- Open reference note alongside new literature note
- Summarize content in your own words under predefined headers:
    - "My Takeaways"
    - "Key Concepts"
    - "Personal Relevance"
- Tag with `#literature` and medium type (book, paper, etc.)
- Link back to specific reference notes and highlight locations

**Guidelines**:

- **Be extremely selective** - only include what truly matters to you
- Keep notes short and concise while preserving value
- This step forces active thinking about consumed content

### Step 4: Permanent Notes (Your Original Ideas)

**Purpose**: Develop fully independent concepts and ideas from your own thinking

**Process**:

- Create when multiple literature notes link to the same concept
- Use Obsidian's graph view to identify emerging clusters
- Write when "half the note is already written for you" through existing connections

**Quality Standards**:

- **Atomic**: One note = one idea
- **Concise**: Should fit on screen without scrolling
- **Understandable**: Clear to anyone with basic topic knowledge
- **Linked**: Include at least one link to other notes for added value

**Guidelines**:

- Ideas often emerge while creating literature notes
- Can create placeholder links before writing full notes
- Focus on concepts that span multiple sources or connect existing ideas

### Step 5: Output & Review (Knowledge Application)

**Purpose**: Transform your knowledge base into published work and gain new insights

**Process**:

- **Content Creation**: Combine multiple permanent notes for:
    - Academic papers
    - Articles or blog posts
    - Presentations
    - Creative projects
- **Regular Review**: Revisit notes and connections periodically
- **Graph Analysis**: Use Obsidian's graph view to identify new connection opportunities

**Benefits**:

- Improves thinking and articulation
- Enables "never starting from scratch" approach
- Creates compounding knowledge over time
