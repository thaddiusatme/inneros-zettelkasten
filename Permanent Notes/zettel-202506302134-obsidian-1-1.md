**Zettelkasten Method in Obsidian**

**Overview**  
The Zettelkasten method is a note-taking and knowledge-management system that helps you link ideas and develop new insights over time. In Obsidianâ€”a markdown editor built around bi-directional linksâ€”you can implement Zettelkasten effectively.

**Key Components**

- **Fleeting Notes**: Quick jottings of thoughts, observations or tasks
    
- **Literature Notes**: Summaries and reflections on external sources such as articles or books
    
- **Permanent Notes**: Atomic ideas written in your own words that are ready to be linked and reused
    

**Obsidian Features**

- File-based folder structure for organizing note types
    
- Tags, internal links and embeds to connect related ideas
    
- Templates (via the core Templates plugin) for rapid note creation
    

**Recommended Folder Structure**

1. `/fleeting` â€“ Temporary notes to be processed
    
2. `/literature` â€“ Source summaries and citations
    
3. `/permanent` â€“ Final, evergreen ideas ready for linking
    

**Templates to Use**

- **Fleeting Note Template**
    
- **Literature Note Template**
    
- **Permanent Note Template**
    
- **Map of Content (MOC)** â€“ an outline of major topics with links to related notes
    

**Suggested Workflow**

1. Capture brief thoughts as fleeting notes
    
2. Process external readings into literature notes
    
3. Distill enduring insights into permanent notes
    
4. Use MOCs and links to group notes for ongoing projects
    

**Benefits**

- Encourages active learning and deep understanding
    
- Makes gaps in your knowledge visible
    
- Fuels idea generation for blog posts, videos and more
    

**Additional Tool: Flowtelic App**  
A bootstrapped note-taking app focused on consistency and daily study sessions.

**Core Principle**  
Consistency in capturing, processing and linking notes is what makes your Zettelkasten truly powerful.
