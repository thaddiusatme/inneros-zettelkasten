### 1. Does it meet your “evergreen value” test?

| Criterion                                                           | Yes/No      | Notes                                                |
| ------------------------------------------------------------------- | ----------- | ---------------------------------------------------- |
| **Aligned with 2025 goals** (news‑powered content, revenue drivers) | **Yes**     | A carousel bot fits your Threads + IG growth plans.  |
| **Uniquely insightful** (not obvious, captures a spark)             | **Yes**     | Points to a clear gap in Claude Projects’ reporting. |
| **Actionable next steps** identified                                | **Partial** | Needs clearer scope, owners, and timeline.           |
| **Reusable reference** for future projects                          | **Yes**     | Could guide similar “content bot” initiatives later. |
_If at least three boxes are “Yes,” promote it to a permanent note._ You have three.

### 2. Recommended permanent‑note structure

1. **Title**  
    `Improve Claude News Reporting → Threads & IG Carousel Bot`
    
2. **Why it matters**  
    Tie explicitly to revenue ($27 kit upsell paths), audience growth, and automation positioning.
    
3. **Desired outcome**
    
    - Claude can pull 5–7 timely AI/SMB stories daily.
        
    - Push formatted summaries to a Threads text post + IG 10‑tile carousel.
        
4. **Key requirements**
    
    - Source filtering (avoid hype, ensure calm/practical tone).
        
    - Template library for carousel design (pastel brand palette).
        
    - Scheduling integration with GoHighLevel or Make.com.
        
5. **Open questions / research**
    - Best news APIs or scrapers for AI/business stories.        
    - Carousel layout automation options (Canva API vs. locally rendered).
        
6. **Next actions** (turn into tasks in your project manager)
    - Draft user stories.
    - Map data flow (Claude → formatter → image generator → publisher).
    - Timebox proof‑of‑concept sprint.

### 3. Immediate next step

Convert the fleeting note to a **Project Note** in your knowledge base, then create three atomic tasks:
1. **Define success metrics** (click‑through, follower growth).
2. **List potential news sources / APIs**.
3. **Sketch carousel template requirements**.
Add those tasks to your inbox for prioritization during your next weekly review.
