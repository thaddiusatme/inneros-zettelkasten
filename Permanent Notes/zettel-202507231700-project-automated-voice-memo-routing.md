# Project: Automated Voice Memo Routing

This note serves as a pointer to a detailed project plan for developing an automated system that transcribes voice memos and routes them to the appropriate person or group.

The goal of this project is to create a scalable productivity tool, potentially as a commercial product, that reduces the manual effort of communication management.

**For full details, see the project brief:**
