# Principles for Zettelkasten Entry and Promotion

A resilient Zettelkasten requires clear, consistent logic for how information enters and evolves within the system. The goal is to balance flexible capture with structured integration, ensuring that fleeting ideas are reliably processed into lasting knowledge.

## 1. All Inputs Lead to the Inbox

Regardless of the entry point—be it mobile, voice memo, desktop, or browser extension—all new information should be captured as a fleeting note and land in a single, designated inbox. This centralizes triage and prevents ideas from getting lost in disparate locations.

## 2. Clear Criteria for Promotion

A fleeting note is promoted to a permanent note only when it meets the following criteria:
-   **Atomicity:** It expresses a single, distinct idea.
-   **Value:** The idea is insightful, non-obvious, and likely to be useful in the future.
-   **Connectivity:** It can be clearly linked to existing concepts within the Zettelkasten.

This process is not about capturing everything, but about curating what is most valuable.

## 3. Standardize with Templates

To enforce consistency, each entry point should use a template (e.g., via Obsidian's Templater plugin) to generate new fleeting notes. This ensures all necessary metadata (status, tags, creation date) is present from the start, which is critical for later automation and review.

## 4. Balance Structure and Flexibility

The system should be structured where it matters and flexible where it doesn't.
-   **Structured Metadata:** Frontmatter (type, status, tags) must be rigid and consistent to support automated workflows.
-   **Flexible Content:** The body of the note should allow for freeform thought and exploration.

This hybrid approach provides the best of both worlds: a reliable system that doesn't stifle creativity.
