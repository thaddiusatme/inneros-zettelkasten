# Vibe Coding Needs Guardrails

## Core Idea
"Vibe coding" (intuitive, flow-state driven development) can be highly productive but requires structured guardrails to prevent technical debt and maintain code quality.

## Why It Matters
Many developers achieve their best work in flow states where they're coding by intuition and "vibe," but without proper guardrails, this approach can lead to inconsistent code quality, poor documentation, and maintenance challenges.

## Key Principles
1. **Structure Enables Freedom** - Paradoxically, clear constraints enable more creative freedom in development
2. **Test-First as Anchor** - TDD provides a safety net for intuitive coding approaches
3. **Checkpoint Rituals** - Regular reflection points prevent flow states from becoming tunnel vision
4. **Documentation as Reflection** - Post-flow documentation captures insights that would otherwise be lost

## Implementation Strategies
- Establish clear "entry" and "exit" rituals for flow-state coding sessions
- Use automated testing as a foundation for creative coding
- Create templates for capturing context during and after flow states
- Balance unstructured exploration with structured review cycles
