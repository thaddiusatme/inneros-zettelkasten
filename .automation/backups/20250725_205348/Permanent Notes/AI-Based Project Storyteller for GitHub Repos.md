**Why it matters** This concept transforms routine development activity into engaging narratives, improving team awareness and stakeholder communication. It supports audience retention for dev-centric platforms and can generate shareable project stories, supporting both marketing and knowledge management goals.

**Desired outcome**
- Automatically generate project stories from commit history and code changes
- Enable review of project evolution for devs, PMs, and external audiences
- Increase project visibility and team engagement
- Integrate narrative exports into newsletters or marketing materials

**Key requirements**

- Access to GitHub API and code parsing tools
- Narrative synthesis engine adaptable to different audiences
- Configurable analysis depth (commits, PRs, file changes, main features)
- Scalable to large repos and multi-repo projects
- Option for visual outputs (timelines, highlights)

**Open questions / research**

- What are the best practices in code activity summarization?
- How to tune narrative tone/complexity per audience?
- Which narrative models map best to dev workflows?
- Are there existing tools that do this well?
- How to handle private or sensitive repo data ethically?

**Next actions**

- Map typical project history elements for narrative extraction
- Survey developers and PMs for desired story elements
- Identify and evaluate current code summarization APIs
- Draft requirements for MVP GitHubâ†’ narrative pipeline
- Sketch UI mockup for story/visual output
