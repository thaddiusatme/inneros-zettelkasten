# AI Needs Rituals

## Core Idea
AI tools are most effective when integrated into structured rituals and workflows rather than used ad-hoc, creating consistency in both input quality and output utility.

## Why It Matters
Without established rituals, AI usage tends to be inconsistent, leading to variable results and reduced trust in the tools. Ritualized AI interactions create predictable patterns that help users develop intuition about capabilities and limitations.

## Key Principles
1. **Consistent Contexts** - Using AI in the same context/environment improves results over time
2. **Input Templates** - Standardized prompt structures yield more consistent outputs
3. **Reflection Cycles** - Regular review of AI interactions improves future usage
4. **Boundary Setting** - Clear delineation of AI vs. human responsibilities

## Implementation Strategies
- Morning/evening AI review rituals
- Standardized prompt templates for common tasks
- Regular calibration of expectations based on results
- Documentation of successful and unsuccessful interactions
