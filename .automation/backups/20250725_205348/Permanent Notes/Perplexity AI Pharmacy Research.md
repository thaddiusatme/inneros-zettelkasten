## The purpose 
- of this prompt is to quickly capture the number of independent pharmacies in a certain state. I use a exclusion list. I ask the LM to generate a table that are active and have an address on Google Map. 
  
  I ask for the table to be formatted in a certain way, with address. 
  
  I remind it to strictly follow this format. 

- This prompt worked alright with Perplexity's Deep Research


## Context
I used this for a project that involved data scraping addresess for BoomBoom, a supplement company


## The Prompt
act as a researcher for independent pharmacies found in Nevada state. I need a table of 25 different locations that are not owned by CSV, WALgreens or hospitals The task is to generate a table of 25 different pharmacies that are currently open, have an address on Google maps. Make sure the table is formatted as name, street address, city, state and zip and whether the location is open/active The results should be provided in a 25 row table Only. No other format is allowed. Add a column as well for if they are independently owned, must not be a part of a hospital network and the addresses must be accurate.
