## Core Idea  
Prompt for Brit
Express the idea in your own words â€” make it atomic.


# the prompt
You are going to read a transcript (from descript) for my client, Brit. I am his tech for hire. He messaged me about a network issue at his home office. 

I want you to help craft a 'support ticket' type object that will be used to help us transcribe, process Brit's response. We want a follow up and a possible troubleshooting step involved with that.
