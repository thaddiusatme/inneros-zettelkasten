**Desired outcome**

- Documented and easily accessible prompt/template for MVP development.
- Faster iteration on new web projects aligned with core business themes.

**Key requirements**

- Indexed access to effective ChatGPT prompts for web MVPs.
- Clear link between prompt features and outlined business goals.
- Up-to-date list of successful MVP case studies as reference.

**Open questions / research**

- How can the prompt format be standardized for various types of web projects?
- What additional context or input improves prompt output quality?
- Are there ways to automate trigger and retrieval of these prompts inside dev workflow?

**Next actions**

- Extract and clean the effective prompt from original build process.
- Document project planning steps linked to prompt.
- Create a template for future website MVP prompts.
- Test template with a new Lovable sub-project.
- Review results and capture improvements.
