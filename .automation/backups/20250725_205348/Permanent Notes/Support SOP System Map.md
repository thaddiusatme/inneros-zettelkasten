# Support SOP System Map

## Core Idea
A well-designed Support SOP System Map creates a visual and navigable representation of support processes, connecting individual SOPs into a coherent system that team members can easily follow and maintain.

## Why It Matters
Support teams often struggle with fragmented documentation, leading to inconsistent service and knowledge silos. A system map approach treats SOPs as an interconnected network rather than isolated documents, making the entire support process more resilient and adaptable.

## Key Components
1. **Entry Points** - How support requests are received and triaged
2. **Process Flows** - Visual representations of decision trees and workflows
3. **Connection Points** - Clear handoffs between team members and departments
4. **Knowledge Base Integration** - Links to relevant resources and documentation
5. **Feedback Loops** - Mechanisms to improve processes based on outcomes

## Implementation Strategy
- Map current support processes before optimizing
- Use visual formats (flowcharts, mind maps) for the system overview
- Create bidirectional links between related SOPs
- Implement version control for the entire system
- Schedule regular reviews to keep the system current
