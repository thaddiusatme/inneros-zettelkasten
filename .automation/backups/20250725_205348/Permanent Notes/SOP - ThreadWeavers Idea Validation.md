## Core Idea  
ThreadWeavers SOP is here


## Why It Matters  
- **Reduces fluff**: Ideas are killed or refined before writing, saving time later.
    
- **Boosts authority**: Every surviving idea carries fresh data and citations, increasing trust.
    
- **Avatar alignment**: Explicitly maps each fact to audience pains/desires, ensuring relevance.
    
- **Process clarity**: Slots cleanly into the ThreadWeavers Free-Tier SOP, preserving numbering and worksheet flow.
