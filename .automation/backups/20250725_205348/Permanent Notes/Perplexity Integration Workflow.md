# Perplexity Integration Workflow

## Core Idea
Integrating Perplexity AI into research and note-taking workflows creates a structured approach to knowledge discovery, validation, and integration into a personal knowledge management system.

## Why It Matters
Perplexity offers unique capabilities for exploratory research, but without a structured workflow, insights often remain disconnected from your knowledge base. A deliberate integration workflow ensures discoveries become part of your permanent knowledge.

## Key Components
1. **Query Formulation** - Structured approaches to asking effective questions
2. **Result Triage** - Systematic evaluation of search results
3. **Knowledge Extraction** - Templates for converting results to notes
4. **Citation Management** - Tracking sources and maintaining provenance
5. **Integration Points** - Connecting new knowledge to existing notes

## Implementation Strategies
- Create standardized query templates for different research needs
- Develop evaluation criteria for search result quality
- Design note templates optimized for Perplexity-sourced information
- Establish regular review cycles for recently added knowledge
