## Core Idea

**Vibe coding and AI-assisted development demand guardrails to stay useful.**  
When using AI and entering a flow state (“vibe coding”), it's easy to lose clarity, context, or run up costs. A Test-Driven Development (TDD) environment can serve as a simple but effective structure to reduce entropy, ground creative exploration, and produce repeatable results.

## Why It Matters

Without structure, AI-enabled development can quickly become chaotic or unsustainable — burning time, compute, and focus. TDD provides a minimalist but powerful ritual: write a test, make it pass, then refactor. This rule-based scaffolding helps filter the noise of “all human knowledge” into personally useful outcomes.

In your case, vibe coding with WindSurf led to both **real success** (your first $350 freelance project) and **real burnout** (AI API overuse and a confusing dev environment). You’ve seen firsthand how structure enables both creative freedom and delivery.

## Practice Suggestions

- Define what “TDD-ready” means in your WindSurf setup (test runners, file structure, mock strategy).
    
- Set up auto-run for your tests to maintain tight feedback loops.
    
- Document as you go — not just the code, but your _thought process_.
    
- Consider building a checklist or lightweight template for future vibe coding sessions.

Would you like me to also help you sketch out a reusable **coding ritual template** for WindSurf + TDD so that each new project starts with those guardrails in place?
