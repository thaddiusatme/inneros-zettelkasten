## Why I'm Saving This

Excellent visual explanation of neural networks from first principles. Grant's animations make complex concepts intuitive.

## Key Takeaways

### Main Insight
> Neural networks learn through gradient descent, adjusting thousands of weights and biases to minimize the difference between predictions and actual results.

**Timestamp**: 3:45

### Supporting Points
- Networks composed of layers: input, hidden, output
- Each neuron has activation value between 0 and 1
- Weights determine how strongly neurons in one layer affect the next
- Training is about finding the right weights to solve a specific problem

## My Thoughts & Applications

### How This Connects
- Links to gradient descent concepts
- Foundation for understanding deep learning
- Computer vision applications

### Action Items
- [ ] Watch rest of the series on backpropagation
- [ ] Implement simple network in Python
- [ ] Explore TensorFlow/PyTorch tutorials
