# But what is a neural network?

**Full Transcript**: [[youtube-aircAruvnKk-2025-10-18]]


Great 3Blue1Brown video explaining neural networks from first principles.

## Key Concepts

- Neural networks are inspired by biological neurons
- Layers: input, hidden, output
- Weights and biases determine neuron activation
- Training adjusts weights to minimize error

## My Notes

The visualization of how weights connect layers is really intuitive. The biological metaphor helps but the math is what actually matters.

## Questions

- How do we choose the number of hidden layers?
- What's the difference between different activation functions?
- How does backpropagation actually work in practice?

## Related Ideas

- Connect to permanent note on gradient descent
- Compare with decision trees for classification
- Explore applications in computer vision
