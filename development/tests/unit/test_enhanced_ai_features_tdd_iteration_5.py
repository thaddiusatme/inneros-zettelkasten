TDD Iteration 5: Enhanced AI Features - Comprehensive Test Suite

RED PHASE: Failing tests based on real data insights from 711-tag validation
Building on TDD Iteration 4's CLI success with focus on AI intelligence improvements.

Real Data Insights to Address:
- Suggestion Rate: 7.3% → 90% target (12x improvement needed)
- Quality Scoring: 100% problematic → Realistic distribution needed
- Contextual Intelligence: Limited → Enhanced semantic understanding
- User Experience: Basic → Interactive with feedback integration

Performance Targets:
- Maintain <30s processing for 1000+ tags
- >90% suggestion rate for problematic tags
- Realistic quality distribution (20% excellent, 60% good, 20% needs-improvement)
