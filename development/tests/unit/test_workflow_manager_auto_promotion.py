"""
TDD RED Phase: Tests for Auto-Promotion System (PBI-004)

Implements quality-gated automatic promotion of notes from Inbox to appropriate
directories based on type and quality score.

Test Coverage:
- Quality threshold filtering (default: 0.7)
- Type-based directory routing (fleeting/literature/permanent)
- Status transitions (promoted â†’ published)
- Timestamp management (promoted_date)
- Dry-run mode (preview without changes)
- Batch processing with summary statistics
- Error handling (low quality, missing type, invalid status)
- Integration with NoteLifecycleManager
