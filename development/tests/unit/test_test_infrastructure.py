RED PHASE: Test Infrastructure Collection Validation

This test validates that all test files can be collected without errors.
Expected to FAIL initially due to:
1. Missing psutil dependency
2. Import errors in evening_screenshot_processor test files
3. Missing src.automation.repair_orphaned_notes module
4. test_cli_imports.py file path mismatch

Following TDD methodology from .windsurf/rules/updated-development-workflow.md
