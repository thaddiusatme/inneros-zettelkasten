TDD Integration Tests: Dedicated CLI Feature Parity Verification

Phase 3 of workflow_demo.py deprecation (ADR-004)
Tests that dedicated CLIs provide feature parity with deprecated workflow_demo.py

RED Phase: These tests should FAIL initially as we verify dedicated CLIs
GREEN Phase: Tests pass after confirming CLI commands work correctly
REFACTOR Phase: Document verification results and update bug reports

Test Coverage (11 critical workflows):
1. Weekly review workflow
2. Enhanced metrics
3. Fleeting triage
4. Fleeting health
5. Process inbox
6. Status check
7. Backup operations
8. Safe batch processing (mocked - safe_workflow_cli exists)
9. Screenshot import (mocked - screenshot_cli exists)
10. YouTube processing (mocked - youtube_cli exists)
11. Reading intake (mocked - reading_intake_cli exists)

Performance Targets:
- Weekly review: <30s
- Enhanced metrics: <30s
- Fleeting operations: <10s
- Status: <5s
- Process inbox: <60s
- Backups: <10s

Test Strategy:
- Use subprocess to test actual CLI execution
- Verify exit codes (0 = success)
- Verify stdout contains expected patterns
- Verify performance targets met
- Mock file system where appropriate
