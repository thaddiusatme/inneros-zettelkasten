# CI Profile: Run with coverage
# Usage: pytest --cov=src --cov-report=term-missing --cov-report=html:htmlcov --cov-fail-under=80
#
# Common workflows:
#   Development (fast):  pytest -m fast
#   All tests (no cov):  pytest
#   With coverage:       pytest --cov=src --cov-report=term-missing
#   Skip integration:    pytest -m "not integration"
#   CI mode:             pytest --cov=src --cov-fail-under=80
