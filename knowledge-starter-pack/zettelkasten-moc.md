# 🗺️ Zettelkasten Map of Content

This Map of Content (MOC) organizes core concepts and workflows for the Zettelkasten method - a powerful approach to building a personal knowledge management system.

## 🎯 Core Principles & Workflow

### **Entry & Promotion**
- [[principles-for-zettelkasten-entry-and-promotion]] - How notes enter and evolve in the system

### **Note Types**
- **Fleeting Notes**: Quick captures, temporary (Inbox)
- **Literature Notes**: Summaries of external sources
- **Permanent Notes**: Atomic ideas in your own words
- **Maps of Content**: Navigation hubs (like this one)

### **The Workflow Cycle**
```
Capture → Process → Connect → Discover
   ↓         ↓         ↓          ↓
 Inbox → Review → Link → Explore
```

## 🤖 AI-Augmented Knowledge Work

### **Strategy & Integration**
- [[strategy-for-ai-augmented-zettelkasten]] - Using AI to enhance (not replace) your thinking
- [[printing-paper-metaphor-for-llm-context]] - Understanding AI context limitations

### **AI Applications**
- **Auto-tagging**: AI suggests tags based on content
- **Connection discovery**: Find non-obvious relationships
- **Content refinement**: Summarize, rephrase, expand ideas
- **Quality assessment**: Evaluate note completeness and clarity

## 📝 Best Practices

### **Writing Atomic Notes**
1. **One idea per note** - If you find "and" or "but," consider splitting
2. **Write in your own words** - Don't copy-paste; process and understand
3. **Make it standalone** - Future you shouldn't need additional context
4. **Link liberally** - Connections are where value emerges

### **Metadata Consistency**
```yaml
---
type: permanent
created: YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM
status: published
tags: [specific, relevant, topics]
visibility: private
---
```

### **Linking Patterns**
- Use `[[descriptive-title]]` format for clarity
- Create bidirectional links when appropriate
- Don't force connections - let them emerge naturally
- MOCs organize without rigid hierarchy

## 🌱 System Growth

### **Healthy Growth Indicators**
- ✅ Notes connect to 2-5 others (not isolated)
- ✅ Regular review and promotion from Inbox
- ✅ MOCs evolve as topics develop
- ✅ Serendipitous discoveries when exploring

### **Warning Signs**
- ⚠️ Large backlog of unprocessed fleeting notes
- ⚠️ Notes with zero connections (orphans)
- ⚠️ Copy-pasted content without processing
- ⚠️ Overly rigid hierarchical organization

- See **Projects MOC** for practical implementations
- See **Concepts MOC** for theoretical foundations

## 🎨 Customization Tips

**For Personal Use**:
- Add custom metadata fields as needed
- Develop your own tagging conventions
- Create domain-specific MOCs (Business, Research, Hobbies)
- Adjust promotion criteria to fit your workflow

**For Teams**:
- Establish shared tagging vocabulary
- Define note type standards
- Create visibility conventions (public/private/shared)
- Set up regular review cycles

## 📚 Learning Resources

### **Foundational Concepts**
- [[example-literature-note]] - Example of capturing external knowledge
- Search "Zettelkasten Method" for comprehensive guides
- Explore Obsidian's graph view to visualize connections

### **Progressive Learning Path**
1. **Week 1-2**: Focus on capturing fleeting notes consistently
2. **Week 3-4**: Practice promoting valuable ideas to permanent notes
3. **Month 2**: Develop linking habits and create first MOCs
4. **Month 3+**: Let your system grow organically, discover emergent patterns

## 🎯 Quick Start Actions

- [ ] Create your first fleeting note in Inbox
- [ ] Promote one fleeting note to permanent
- [ ] Link your new permanent note to at least one existing note
- [ ] Create a topic-specific MOC for your primary interest area
- [ ] Review your Inbox weekly

**Remember**: Your Zettelkasten is a garden, not a database. It grows organically through consistent care, not perfect planning.
