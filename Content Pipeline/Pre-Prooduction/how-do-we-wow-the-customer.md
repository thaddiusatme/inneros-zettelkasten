## Hook  
how-do-we wow the customer

## Outline  
- Premise:  
- Key points:  
- CTA:  

## Notes  
Loose thoughts, links, voice memos.

“1. What is the product or experience I want to create or transform into a wow? The customer’s lobby experience.
“2. How will the customer feel as a result of this experience? (In other words, what is the specific outcome we want to create?) The customer should feel we must be an extraordinary company because he has never had a lobby experience like this. He assumes we are somehow really different, and can’t wait to experience more.”
“3. What specific expectations does the typical customer bring to this experience?”
“4. What does failing to meet customers’ expectations for this experience look like?”
“5. What does exceeding customers’ expectations for this experience look like?”
