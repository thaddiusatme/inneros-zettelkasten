# The Prompt for Next Chat Session

## Objective
Continue TDD development of Safety-First Directory Organization system OR pivot to P0 templater bug fix. We want to perform TDD framework with red, green, refactor phases, then git commit and create lessons learned. This equals one iteration.

## Current Achievement Summary
**MAJOR SUCCESS**: Completed foundational Safety-First Directory Organization system using strict TDD methodology.

### ‚úÖ **What's Production-Ready:**
- **P0-1 Backup System**: 10/10 tests passing - Timestamped backups, rollback capability, production logging
- **P0-2 Dry Run System**: 10/10 tests passing - Type-based planning, comprehensive reporting, zero mutations
- **P0-3 Link Preservation**: Core architecture established - Data structures, regex patterns, planning framework

### üìÅ **Current Branch:** 
`feat/directory-organization-p0-backup-system` 

### üéØ **Real Problem Being Solved:**
Critical workflow issue where notes in `Inbox/` have mismatched type fields (`type: permanent` but still in `Inbox/` instead of `Permanent Notes/`). Our system provides the safe, validated solution.

## Next Iteration Options

### **Option A: Complete Directory Organization (Recommended)**
**Branch:** Continue on `feat/directory-organization-p0-backup-system` 
**TDD Target:** P1-1 Actual File Moves with Safety-First execution
- **RED**: Write failing tests for safe file execution with backup verification
- **GREEN**: Implement minimal file move execution using existing P0-1/P0-2/P0-3 infrastructure  
- **REFACTOR**: Add progress reporting, batch operations, comprehensive validation
- **COMMIT**: Complete end-to-end directory organization system
- **LESSONS**: Document production-ready Zettelkasten organization solution

### **Option B: Pivot to Templater Bug Fix (Critical Path Priority)**  
**Branch:** Create new `fix/templater-created-placeholder` 
**TDD Target:** Fix `created: {{date:YYYY-MM-DD HH:mm}}` templater processing failure
- **RED**: Write failing tests for templater placeholder detection and replacement
- **GREEN**: Implement minimal fix in `WorkflowManager.process_inbox_note()` write path
- **REFACTOR**: Add bulk repair script, comprehensive templater token handling
- **COMMIT**: Resolve critical template automation blocking issue  
- **LESSONS**: Document templater integration and metadata reliability patterns

## Current Development Context

### **Established Infrastructure:**
- `DirectoryOrganizer` class with backup/rollback/dry-run capabilities
- **20+ passing tests** across P0-1, P0-2, P0-3 phases
- Safety-first principles proven and validated
- Production-grade error handling and logging

### **Key Files Ready:**
- `development/src/utils/directory_organizer.py` - Core functionality (282 lines)
- `development/tests/unit/utils/test_directory_organizer.py` - Test suite
- `Projects/p0-1-backup-system-lessons-learned.md` - Documented learnings
- `Projects/p0-2-dry-run-system-lessons-learned.md` - TDD insights

### **Quick Verification Commands:**
```bash
# Verify current test status
cd development && PYTHONPATH=src python3 -m pytest tests/unit/utils/test_directory_organizer.py -v

# Check git status
git status

# View current branch
git branch
```

### **InnerOS Rules Compliance:**
- Following v4.0 guidelines for safety-first development
- TDD methodology successfully applied (RED‚ÜíGREEN‚ÜíREFACTOR cycles)
- Integration-first approach leveraging existing AI workflows
- Critical path management with comprehensive testing

## Recommended Next Action

**CONTINUE Option A** - Complete the directory organization system to provide immediate value solving the real workflow issue, then tackle templater bugs in subsequent iteration.

**Rationale:** 
- We have momentum and solid foundations established
- Addresses documented user workflow problem with production-ready solution
- Demonstrates complete TDD cycle success from foundation to execution
- Provides immediate value for organizing misplaced notes safely

**Alternative:** If templater bug is blocking daily workflow, pivot to Option B for critical path resolution.

## Success Metrics for Next Iteration
- [ ] All existing tests continue passing (20+ tests)
- [ ] New P1-1 tests written and passing
- [ ] Zero file mutations during development (TDD safety)
- [ ] Production-ready file move execution
- [ ] Comprehensive lessons learned documentation
- [ ] Clean git commit with detailed message
