[00:00] what's going on everybody good morning
[00:01] good evening or wherever you are and
[00:03] whatever time it is and welcome back to
[00:05] yet another video with you man and
[00:07] merger hollick and ladies and gentlemen
[00:10] welcome to a redo of our carthage
[00:13] faction overview for the divided to para
[00:16] overhaul mod for total war room 2.
[00:19] that's right ladies and gentlemen we are
[00:20] re-checking out the carthaginian
[00:23] campaign for the grand campaign that is
[00:25] of course um this is for
[00:29] two reasons one it is in preparation of
[00:32] our upcoming carthaginian campaign that
[00:34] we'll be releasing in the same week that
[00:37] this faction overview video will be
[00:39] released
[00:40] so uh probably about a few days after
[00:42] this overview goes up you guys will be
[00:44] seeing that being released so make sure
[00:47] you go ahead and check that out if
[00:48] you're watching this far off in the
[00:49] future i'll be sure to drop a link down
[00:51] below for you guys to come along and
[00:53] check it out and join us on the wild
[00:55] ride that is our cafeteria campaign it's
[00:58] been a lot of fun in recording so far
[01:00] then the second reason is that the first
[01:02] faction overview i ever did for the
[01:04] channel was carthage and admittedly it
[01:08] wasn't my best work and we didn't go
[01:10] into extreme details about the units i
[01:13] talked about some of the good units in
[01:14] it stats but that was back when i was
[01:18] doing military rosters where i wouldn't
[01:20] show you the actual units so we're going
[01:23] to redo the campaign overview section
[01:26] and we are going to go into the military
[01:28] view for military land units and for
[01:31] naval units that's why we'll actually be
[01:33] looking at some ships that's going to be
[01:35] a lot of fun
[01:36] so this overview will be a lot more
[01:38] detailed than my previous faction
[01:40] overview and in addition i've actually
[01:43] revised the difficulty rating and
[01:45] overall verdict for carthage at least in
[01:48] my opinion um there hasn't been a lot of
[01:50] actual changes for carthage but there
[01:52] has been changes to the campaign overall
[01:55] since i uh did it my previous
[01:57] carthaginian overview so um feel free to
[02:00] go check out that previous overview if
[02:02] you would like it is still relevant in
[02:04] my opinion however some things have
[02:06] changed and i think the difficulty
[02:09] rating has been appropriately adjusted
[02:12] to kind of reflect the campaign
[02:14] difficulty a little bit better so
[02:15] without any further ado let's get into
[02:18] it
[02:19] so everybody let's start off with the
[02:21] carthaginian buffs at all of e3 dynasty
[02:23] share we have the phoenician trade
[02:25] heritage buff which gives plus two
[02:27] percent wealth from all commerce
[02:29] buildings very nice buff to have and
[02:32] obviously pushes you to have a commerce
[02:35] orientated economy notice that it says
[02:38] commerce buildings that is not including
[02:40] trade trade is separate from commerce
[02:43] buildings um although trade is always
[02:45] going to be very nice to have as well
[02:47] then we also have the diverse armies
[02:49] both which gives you a minus fifty
[02:52] percent mercenary and uh elephant upkeep
[02:55] cost which is very nice because your
[02:57] armies will be made entirely out of
[02:59] mercenaries and some of your armies will
[03:01] probably have elephants although i don't
[03:02] recommend doing it for all of them but
[03:04] we'll get into that a little bit later
[03:07] so moving on to the individual dynasties
[03:09] of carthage you have the hanani dynasty
[03:12] the hannah dynasty is focused on
[03:14] diplomacy using most scenarios and
[03:16] having a little bit of extra movement
[03:19] now why is that well you have these
[03:20] statesmen buff you have diplomatic
[03:22] bonuses with all factions
[03:25] so generally diplomacy should be easy
[03:27] for you especially if you're playing on
[03:29] normal difficulty which keep in mind is
[03:31] how i conduct these faction overviews i
[03:34] am i'm doing this under the assumption
[03:36] you're playing on normal difficulty for
[03:38] any faction you're trying because that's
[03:40] what i recommend for all casual di
[03:42] players and even
[03:44] uh regular di players who just prefer to
[03:47] have diplomacy in their game
[03:49] next up we have the pioneers buff which
[03:52] increases movement for all forces so not
[03:55] just your army but also your navies very
[03:58] nice buff to have it's always nice to be
[04:00] able to outmaneuver your enemies and
[04:02] having buffs like this will obviously
[04:04] help you do that however you then have
[04:07] the military underdogs debuff which
[04:09] increases non-mercenary recruitment
[04:12] costs
[04:13] so basically this is kind of pushing you
[04:15] to continue that agenda of using
[04:17] mercenaries over proper carthaginian aka
[04:20] phoenician soldiers um because they'll
[04:23] be more expensive and so obviously being
[04:26] a large empire you can't afford to
[04:29] constantly be using high quality troops
[04:32] or high costing troops especially all
[04:34] across your empire you need to try and
[04:37] focus a little bit more on what's going
[04:39] to be more efficient so that's it for
[04:41] the hanan dynasty
[04:43] going to the mega net dynasty they are a
[04:45] little bit more focused on using
[04:47] carthaginian troops less public order
[04:49] issues however you also have less tax
[04:52] because you have the military reforms
[04:54] buff which decreases upkeep costs for
[04:57] all non-mercenary units thus you're
[05:00] generally encouraged to use proper
[05:03] carthaginian troops or this also applies
[05:05] to aor units so you might want to levy
[05:08] troops from local areas that you move
[05:10] into
[05:11] just as a little bit of an example there
[05:14] you then have the iron fist buff which
[05:16] increases resistance to foreign
[05:18] occupation
[05:19] not a bad uh buff to have at all then
[05:22] you have the debuff
[05:24] of uh corruption which decreases your
[05:26] tax rate now this is going to sting a
[05:28] little bit
[05:29] um and in my opinion out of all of the
[05:32] factions you could play as the magna
[05:34] dynasty out of the three is probably
[05:37] the lesser
[05:38] of the three um
[05:41] that's just my personal preference it
[05:43] kind of depends on
[05:44] how you like to play um carthage but
[05:48] having that decreased tax rate debuff
[05:51] that's really going to hurt because tax
[05:53] is such a big deal in terms to your
[05:55] income um it almost doesn't matter what
[05:57] kind of economy you go with if you have
[05:59] low tax then you're going to struggle
[06:02] and then combining a lower tax rate
[06:04] alongside empire maintenance and whatnot
[06:06] that's where you're going to see your
[06:07] economy kind of plummet a little so
[06:10] um that's just my personal opinion on
[06:12] that though we didn't have the barkid
[06:14] dynasty the markets of course
[06:17] um we have the agricultural reforms buff
[06:20] where they're getting increased
[06:22] agricultural income pretty
[06:24] straightforward nothing too special but
[06:27] it does help
[06:28] you then have the popular support buff
[06:31] which gives you public order bonuses
[06:33] from punic culture this is kind of
[06:36] encouraging you to try and solidify your
[06:38] hold on regions where you have cities
[06:41] you might have a few provinces well you
[06:43] do indeed have provinces where you don't
[06:45] have all of these cities under your
[06:47] control inside of them so to try and
[06:49] help you that you need to really try and
[06:51] focus on increasing your penit culture
[06:53] because you get that extra little boost
[06:55] for public order bonuses
[06:57] so that way you don't have to station
[06:59] troops in every single region under your
[07:01] control to try and keep public order
[07:04] down
[07:05] so generally speaking the barakah
[07:07] dynasty is kind of focused on
[07:09] centralizing its position
[07:12] speaking of that though you have punic
[07:14] faith as your debuff which gives you
[07:16] moderate diplomatic penalties with latin
[07:19] iberian and greek cultures
[07:22] so not only are we trying to centralize
[07:25] our positions by increasing european
[07:27] culture but you're probably going to be
[07:29] at war on multiple fronts and you're
[07:31] going to struggle for allies because
[07:34] latin obviously means rome the iberian
[07:37] uh cultures are obviously all going to
[07:38] be in iberia so you're going to have
[07:41] very few friends in iberia if any at all
[07:44] and then greek cultures in general are
[07:46] going to be hostile towards you so
[07:47] that's going to be a little bit of a
[07:48] bummer for you um because you are
[07:51] bordered by multiple greek factions to
[07:53] your east you have the ptolemies you
[07:55] have serenica you then have the um old
[07:59] greek city-states that you know
[08:01] sometimes do survive uh then you have
[08:04] syracuse and whatnot so that is going to
[08:06] hurt you a little bit you might struggle
[08:08] to get trade when you're playing
[08:10] azerbaijan but we'll talk about that a
[08:12] little bit more very shortly so without
[08:14] any further ado let's go into the part
[08:16] one section of this video where we'll
[08:18] talk about the grand campaign situation
[08:20] for the barca dynasty why you play as
[08:24] carthage
[08:25] okay everybody here we are on the grand
[08:27] campaign map for carthage we start off
[08:30] with a whopping 14 cities
[08:34] that is the most that any faction has on
[08:37] turn one in the grand campaign that is
[08:40] um follow very closely by
[08:42] the psalmist dynasty in egypt and then
[08:45] the salukis and i don't believe there's
[08:47] any other factions that have quite as
[08:49] many cities under their direct control
[08:51] the salukis probably have more if you
[08:54] include their client states well they do
[08:55] in fact have more if you include client
[08:57] states however i'm just talking about
[08:59] direct cities um you then start off with
[09:02] two provinces completely under your
[09:04] control and then you have another
[09:06] province which is technically under your
[09:08] control although you have only one city
[09:11] inside of it and the rest belong to your
[09:13] client states um we have three armies
[09:16] the first army is in carthage itself led
[09:19] by your leader who at this point for us
[09:21] is
[09:23] hannibal now keep in mind this is not
[09:25] the hannibal that crossed the alps this
[09:28] is his grandfather actually um the grant
[09:31] campaign starts in 278 bc
[09:35] so it's still quite a while before the
[09:37] hannibal is around so what we have is
[09:39] hannibal's grandfather who is leading
[09:41] the american dynasty and then we have
[09:44] his son hamilkar
[09:46] this is hamilkar who will he will be the
[09:49] father of hannibal so as long as you let
[09:51] the little fella live he will get
[09:53] hannibal a little bit later on in the
[09:54] campaign depending on how many turns pe
[09:57] you have your campaign set to um
[10:00] hannibal might not come until around
[10:02] turn 150 or so to be honest it could
[10:05] take quite a while um but if you're
[10:08] playing on the standard four turns per
[10:10] year then it might be a little bit less
[10:12] than that
[10:13] but either way we're playing as the
[10:15] barca dynasty as i said you start off
[10:17] with hannibal 27 years old
[10:19] married to lissa 25 and then you have
[10:21] your son hellmukar he was two years old
[10:24] at the time
[10:25] there will be more children as well
[10:27] depending on how your spouses get along
[10:30] like i said we have the one army inside
[10:32] of carthage itself right here
[10:34] we then have your second army in
[10:36] panoramas in northwestern sicily and
[10:38] then we have one more army all the way
[10:41] over here in the city of mastia in
[10:43] iberia or what will become new carthage
[10:47] eventually um and that's it that's all
[10:50] your military forces at the beginning of
[10:52] your campaign you have no navies this is
[10:55] a new change um in the 1.3 update so
[10:59] your army compositions are different and
[11:01] you have no navy and you also have no
[11:03] agents although you can recruit agents
[11:07] on turn one you can get spies and you
[11:09] can get dignitaries just can't get
[11:11] champions instantly
[11:13] so you can
[11:14] rectify that pretty quickly if you like
[11:17] i do recommend trying to get
[11:19] most
[11:19] of your regions as quick as you can
[11:21] however you do have a lot to do
[11:24] because like i said you have 14 cities
[11:27] and so let's obviously have a quick look
[11:29] at where they are stores so we'll start
[11:31] from the west and work out work our way
[11:33] east
[11:34] so um obviously we hold territory in the
[11:38] migrab region in north africa aka modern
[11:41] day morocco you have the city of chingus
[11:43] and the city of sega both are in the
[11:45] province of mauritania um you then also
[11:48] have the gaitullions to your southwest
[11:50] who are very neutral they're actually
[11:52] quite friendly towards you you don't
[11:54] have any diplomacy with them but on turn
[11:56] one they will take trade and
[11:57] non-aggression and then they will be
[11:59] quite happy and generally won't attack
[12:01] you unless you're looking very weak and
[12:03] especially if you're playing on hard
[12:04] difficulty um north of tingus we have
[12:08] the city of gadir it's your most western
[12:11] iberian possession inside the province
[12:13] of baitica alongside two other cities
[12:16] aplacia and cartoon to the north
[12:18] you then have mastia as i said earlier
[12:21] this is in the province of hispania you
[12:23] have mastia and then ibosum which is the
[12:26] balearic islands this is where you will
[12:28] get
[12:29] your baleric slingers if we get up to
[12:31] level two of any kind of settlement you
[12:34] get your baleric slingers as an aor unit
[12:36] so you may want to upgrade those as
[12:38] quick as you can you can also get
[12:40] mercenaries as well in these neighboring
[12:42] regions um can we get it here and master
[12:44] in china well let's jump double check
[12:46] yes we can
[12:47] right here you can get balletic slingers
[12:50] um heading back down towards africa
[12:52] though we have the city of idaho iol is
[12:55] in the province of new media and it is
[12:58] that
[12:59] funny little province i told you about
[13:00] where you can actually install edix
[13:03] because you have all of the other cities
[13:06] under your control through clients you
[13:09] have the message lee and the missile to
[13:11] yourself the missile owned the city of
[13:13] capsule and the mercedes lee own uh
[13:16] kethon right up here and then they own
[13:18] the city of dimidia as well so because
[13:21] all four of those cities are in the same
[13:23] province as i o you can use your edicts
[13:26] um so it might be a nice idea for you to
[13:29] try and use your bread and games edict
[13:31] early on here try and increase public
[13:33] order there because it's not really
[13:34] worth sending an army or a general just
[13:37] to this one little city in this massive
[13:39] region because you don't control it all
[13:42] so moving on from the city of iowa we
[13:44] work our way east we have carthage at
[13:47] the heart of your empire of course
[13:49] north of carthage though we have
[13:51] sardinia and corsica sardinia has the
[13:55] city of corrales which is a walled
[13:57] settlement and this is of course in the
[13:59] province of corsica and sardinia um both
[14:02] of the islands have only one settlement
[14:04] on each of them up here to the north
[14:06] though you have the city of alalia
[14:09] this is where you get your iron from
[14:11] though and actually i should have
[14:12] mentioned that before um for your other
[14:15] province i mean forever cities in iowa
[14:17] you have wood and then in gadir you have
[14:20] wine and that's it for your western
[14:22] possession so out of all of your cities
[14:23] in the west you only have two that give
[14:26] you actual resources which is kind of
[14:28] disappointing i would have liked to have
[14:30] seen iberia especially be a little bit
[14:32] more lucrative um maybe even mastia have
[14:35] like silver mines or something like that
[14:37] but anyway um
[14:39] corrales has no resources the city of uh
[14:42] alalia does
[14:44] um and it's one province that's under
[14:46] your control so again you can use your
[14:47] edicts as you wish moving east we have
[14:50] sicily where you have two out of three
[14:53] cities inside of the province of sicalia
[14:55] aka sicily um we have panoramas which
[14:58] has fish and you then have acrylics
[15:00] which has grain um it previously did
[15:03] have iron but it doesn't seem to anymore
[15:05] that's an interesting change
[15:08] i definitely recall it having iron now
[15:10] but anyway
[15:11] that's your sicilian possessions like i
[15:14] said we have carthage down here in the
[15:16] center
[15:17] carthage is in the province of africa
[15:19] which is entirely under your control and
[15:22] is one of those cities i mean one of
[15:23] those provinces where you can begin
[15:26] using edx straight away you then have
[15:28] the city of thapsos to your direct south
[15:30] which produces fish it doesn't have the
[15:33] city of lpqy aka leptus magna i believe
[15:36] this is actually is historically um you
[15:39] have grain there so obviously hinting
[15:42] towards the
[15:43] bountiful food available in in north
[15:45] africa at the time and then you have the
[15:48] city of euthranta your most far eastern
[15:50] possession
[15:52] bordering cyrene aka serenica way out
[15:55] here you're also bordering the nesimones
[15:58] down here and you're
[15:59] bordering the garamantians who have the
[16:02] city of garma and the city of tilamenti
[16:04] which actually also has animal levels
[16:07] right here um what's the actual
[16:10] resource for that call though producing
[16:12] leather so same thing
[16:14] um you might want to come down get this
[16:16] lever it's actually a pretty nice
[16:17] resource to have pretty rare on the
[16:19] green campaign map
[16:21] but do be aware as soon as you get off
[16:23] the coast and head inland um you'll see
[16:26] all of this yellow right here that's
[16:28] because it's desert you're going to take
[16:30] attrition as you come out here
[16:33] so that is going to be pretty rough for
[16:35] your armies but i mean you can try to
[16:37] follow these little sneaky roads out
[16:40] there but you'll still suffer attrition
[16:42] so
[16:43] uh might not be worth fighting the
[16:44] garamantians but anyway i'll talk a
[16:46] little bit more about that later
[16:48] speaking on diplomacy we have
[16:51] a war you have war with emperors at the
[16:53] beginning of the campaign
[16:55] however eparus is essentially a
[16:57] non-issue for you especially if you're
[17:00] playing on normal difficulty emperors
[17:02] will
[17:03] nine point nine nine nine nine nine
[17:05] times out of ten get overrun by rome and
[17:08] get wiped out within 15-20 turns if they
[17:11] survive more than 20 tons in your
[17:13] campaign then i would be shocked um i've
[17:16] done a lot of test campaigns at carthage
[17:18] i'm doing my main one now
[17:20] every single time i play as carthage i
[17:22] see everest getting wiped i have heard
[17:25] that it is possible for emperors to beat
[17:27] rome but
[17:28] i sincerely doubt you'll see that in
[17:31] your campaigns
[17:32] um
[17:33] yeah just emperors is going to get
[17:35] destroyed i wouldn't worry about being
[17:37] at war with them at all oh actually
[17:39] let's go back
[17:40] um like i said you have the silly and
[17:42] the messaly to your southwest down here
[17:44] in the far bright green
[17:47] they are your client states um
[17:50] do we have any other trade the only
[17:52] trade agreement that you have is with
[17:54] rome of all factions rome starts are
[17:57] very friendly towards you um
[17:59] you could actually get an alliance with
[18:02] rome on turn one you can offer them a
[18:04] defensive alliance and they are
[18:06] interested
[18:07] however
[18:09] it's not really worth getting you can
[18:11] try to get it if you like but there is a
[18:14] hard-coded system in the grand campaign
[18:17] that basically tailors rome to hate you
[18:20] and then declare war in you
[18:23] rome does not have to take sicily
[18:27] in order for them to declare warranty
[18:29] previously as soon as you occupy the
[18:31] city of syracuse that automatically made
[18:34] rome hate you and declare war on you
[18:37] now you'll still have that same event
[18:39] happen if you take syracuse however
[18:41] if you avoid taking syracuse you will
[18:44] still get rome declaring war only it is
[18:46] very random and to be honest i kind of
[18:49] don't like that i think it's a little
[18:50] bit annoying but i mean is what it is um
[18:53] it is trying to recreate historical
[18:55] authenticity and events
[18:58] basically
[18:59] if you're playing his carthage no matter
[19:00] what you do at some point you will be at
[19:03] war with rome
[19:04] however that does not mean that you
[19:06] can't get peace with roman that you
[19:08] can't somehow cozy them back into being
[19:11] friendly it is possible if you throw a
[19:14] lot of money at them you declare war on
[19:15] their enemies you always release their
[19:17] troops when you beat their armies um
[19:20] there are ways to kind of manipulate the
[19:22] ai into being friendly with you so
[19:25] expect wool with rome
[19:27] it's it is possible to get them to be
[19:30] your friend again after you get into war
[19:32] with them but extremely hard to pull off
[19:34] and in my opinion sometimes not really
[19:37] worth it um it's only worth if you're
[19:39] trying to pull off a little bit of an a
[19:41] historical campaign perhaps or if you
[19:44] would like to save room for the late
[19:46] game which i think would be a lot more
[19:48] fun uh to try and do that if you can
[19:51] imagine playing his carthage and you're
[19:53] fight and you're facing off marion
[19:54] legionnaires in the middle of sicily
[19:57] that would be pretty epic and hard to
[19:59] deal with but anyway um that is your
[20:02] diplomacy on turn one
[20:04] you have no other pre-made agreements
[20:07] you do have the guy tully to your west
[20:09] over here who are very friendly and are
[20:11] looking to get traded on aggression with
[20:13] you um for whatever reason if you're
[20:16] playing as the barker dynasty like i
[20:18] generally recommend and what i see
[20:20] people doing the most as well
[20:22] um you will see hostility coming in from
[20:25] syranika they'll actually declare war on
[20:27] you
[20:28] the ptolemies also don't like you early
[20:30] on although you can get trade with them
[20:32] pretty easily especially if you help
[20:34] them in the war against serenica um the
[20:37] core greek cities up here in greece
[20:39] won't like you
[20:41] uh other greek cities such as masali
[20:43] also won't like you won't want to get
[20:45] traded with you unless you're helping
[20:46] them fight their enemies although that's
[20:48] kind of hard to pull up with masalia
[20:50] though they're kind of snobbish up there
[20:52] iberians you can get trade with many of
[20:55] the iberian factions but
[20:57] none of them like you and none of them
[20:59] will get non-aggression unless you
[21:00] really influence them aka
[21:04] send them gifts and declare war on the
[21:06] enemies stuff like that
[21:08] um so generally with diplomacy the only
[21:11] kind of reliable thing you have is your
[21:13] new midian allies
[21:15] and
[21:16] to be honest they're not always so
[21:19] reliable the numidians can declare war
[21:21] on me um and they can screw you over
[21:24] while you're in the middle of war
[21:25] especially when you're fighting rome and
[21:27] that's when you'll see the client states
[21:30] that are under your control when you're
[21:31] at your weakest rebel against you and
[21:33] declare war i can't guarantee it will
[21:36] happen to you but it is a possibility so
[21:39] you might want to just early on betray
[21:41] them solidify your position in africa
[21:43] and then
[21:44] feel a little bit more secure at home
[21:46] that's kind of up to you but
[21:48] um that is your diplomacy on turn one
[21:52] diplomacy kind of can go in any
[21:54] direction as you move forward in the
[21:55] campaign and you can influence things
[21:58] perhaps we can do a video on how to
[21:59] influence the ai and nations in the
[22:02] future but generally speaking your
[22:04] diplomacy is going to be pretty hard
[22:06] headed if you're playing as a barker
[22:08] dynasty and even then if you're playing
[22:10] as the other dynasties uh you still
[22:12] won't get all that many differences in
[22:14] the campaign two minor things to add on
[22:16] to your diplomacy as well as the
[22:18] garamantians will almost always declare
[22:20] war on you and your new midian allies
[22:23] pain in the butt to fight and they will
[22:24] often attack your coastal possessions so
[22:27] you'll probably want to get an army down
[22:29] here to left this as soon as you can and
[22:31] then you have um the illyrians you have
[22:33] the deorsi faction up here now you
[22:36] actually can see on turn one they will
[22:38] take trade with you so you might want to
[22:40] get an admiral and uh kind of cruise up
[22:44] the adriatic coast and then go east
[22:46] towards uh the black sea and try and get
[22:49] some trade with her with other
[22:50] barbarians because they don't have any
[22:52] cultural aversion towards you at least
[22:54] nothing too significant so could be
[22:56] worth considering uh getting back to
[22:59] carthage let's talk about your
[23:01] population
[23:03] so your population overall is looking
[23:05] pretty fantastic and there's one key
[23:07] ingredient to that and that is you have
[23:10] 14 cities on turn one
[23:12] so um you do you definitely have a lot
[23:15] of variety you have a lot of options in
[23:17] what kind of armies you want to recruit
[23:19] however there is one kind of thing you
[23:21] need to be aware of and that is it for
[23:24] example if we click on carthage itself
[23:26] and we check out the population
[23:28] you will see the phoenician social class
[23:31] your
[23:32] um basically nobility or core
[23:34] carthaginians are pretty limited in
[23:36] numbers they're only 1200 on turn one
[23:39] that will increase over time however it
[23:41] increases slowly and it is not reliable
[23:44] thus you will not be able to recruit
[23:47] many armies with just core carthaginian
[23:50] troops
[23:51] uh if we go to recruitment you can see
[23:53] these troops for example carthaginian
[23:55] hoplites come from the phoenician social
[23:58] class yes i can recruit what uh six
[24:01] units on turn one but then that's going
[24:03] to drain all of the phoenicians out of
[24:05] carthage at least all of the recruitable
[24:07] phoenicians um what you want to do
[24:09] instead is try to use units that come
[24:11] from your subject social class for
[24:13] example libyan hoplets not as good as
[24:16] your crafted julians but they're pretty
[24:17] close and you have 20 000 of them
[24:20] available on turn one just in the city
[24:23] of carthage alone
[24:24] uh if we go up to corrales for example
[24:27] we're going to see a similar pattern
[24:29] 1200 phoenicians are available 21 000 uh
[24:33] subject
[24:34] people are available for you
[24:37] and so this is a patent that you will
[24:39] see throughout your entire empire and
[24:41] the majority of your cities will have a
[24:42] large subject population a minor libya
[24:45] phoenician population very limited
[24:47] phoenicians and then a somewhat limited
[24:50] foreigners population although it's
[24:52] still pretty solid for foreigners
[24:54] especially as you begin um
[24:56] taking over
[24:58] new settlements that don't have any puny
[25:00] culture in them for example when you
[25:02] march into southern italy you'll want to
[25:04] have your army's speaker post primarily
[25:06] of mercenary units that are foreigners
[25:09] so that way you can replenish them
[25:10] pretty easily
[25:11] um however down here in sicily
[25:14] you will still have a pretty healthy mix
[25:17] of your population um depending on what
[25:20] city you're in for example once you take
[25:22] syracuse
[25:23] depending on the cultural balance there
[25:25] um you might have way more foreigners
[25:27] than you would of your standard
[25:29] population um but overall
[25:33] you have very few issues with your
[25:35] public order the only one issue is that
[25:37] you will struggle to maintain armies
[25:39] composed entirely of your core
[25:42] carthaginian population
[25:45] that is intentional and it's kind of
[25:46] reminiscent of the spartan situation in
[25:49] which the spartan
[25:51] nation has very limited true spartans
[25:54] they can recruit however luckily for you
[25:56] as carthage you do not rely on
[25:58] carthaginians to make up the bulk of
[26:00] your enemies of your armies if anything
[26:03] they are just a core kind of elite
[26:05] section of your army that you should
[26:07] keep in reserve and only use when
[26:09] absolutely necessary or when you're
[26:12] perhaps fighting in africa and know you
[26:13] can replace your carthaginian losses
[26:16] pretty easily um although you could
[26:19] always try to take a general and march
[26:22] in between settlements in africa or
[26:23] wherever um
[26:26] and recruit just core card virginian
[26:28] troops i will try to do that in my
[26:29] campaign just for the sake of it could
[26:31] be fun
[26:32] but it's going to be a little bit
[26:33] difficult to maintain because as soon as
[26:35] you take any losses when you're overseas
[26:38] saying in italy for example um you're
[26:40] not going to be able to replenish your
[26:42] troops it's going to take a long time
[26:44] um so you will have to change your army
[26:47] over time it's kind of annoying but
[26:49] something to keep in mind overall the
[26:51] population is looking great
[26:53] um speaking of great your economy your
[26:56] economy is looking very very solid um
[26:59] your economy is very compass driven and
[27:02] trade driven both for two separate
[27:04] things keep in mind the dei
[27:06] um you can opt for industry and
[27:08] agriculture if you like especially when
[27:11] you have provinces such as africa
[27:14] that do have extra food inside inside of
[27:17] them from fish and grain
[27:20] but you have a lot of cities in the
[27:22] province of africa that can produce food
[27:25] combining that alongside with fish of
[27:26] course um and then you can try to sell
[27:29] your food if you like you use the
[27:31] export agricultural
[27:34] edict where is here it is
[27:36] you can use it and get a massive boost
[27:38] to your economy especially if you're
[27:39] playing as a markets uh it might not be
[27:42] the best thing for you to do early on
[27:43] but if you tailor your building
[27:45] composition right
[27:47] um especially now that we have six slots
[27:49] available in cities that do have that
[27:51] many uh for example carthage will get to
[27:54] six slots
[27:55] then you can um really get your economy
[27:58] flowing in kind of any category that you
[28:01] want
[28:02] generally speaking i trade in a in
[28:05] a commerce driven economy are your core
[28:07] kind of tenants that's what is expected
[28:09] of you and that's probably what the
[28:11] easiest option is for you what i would
[28:13] recommend
[28:14] um overall looking great you have some
[28:17] resources available not a lot though
[28:20] especially considering how many cities
[28:21] you have under your control but you have
[28:24] some um
[28:25] resources nearby for example you have
[28:27] olives right here at iplacia
[28:29] has iron
[28:31] city of r says ah uh silver
[28:34] uh nemesia has copper so you can get
[28:37] some pretty good resources once you
[28:39] begin to move into iberia
[28:41] um in my opinion though iberia is still
[28:44] pretty lackluster in its resources
[28:46] because i think it should have more for
[28:47] example cartoon but should have
[28:49] something i think uh master should have
[28:51] something as well
[28:53] um
[28:54] i mean
[28:55] it's not terrible in iberia it's just
[28:58] not as powerful as it's made out to be
[29:00] historically that's my biggest kind of
[29:02] gripe with iberia as a whole
[29:04] in dei um but you know that's just kind
[29:07] of how it works out and it can be a very
[29:09] lucrative
[29:10] province to have uh or area of the map
[29:13] to have if you control all of iberia
[29:15] but it's not really gonna make you a lot
[29:18] of cash very very quickly it's gonna
[29:19] take time to build up and just to design
[29:22] your provinces in a way that are
[29:24] beneficial to you but anyway ladies and
[29:27] gentlemen that's it for the carthaginian
[29:29] campaign overview section of this video
[29:31] we've talked about your diplomacy your
[29:34] economy your population and your overall
[29:36] starting position overall it's looking
[29:38] pretty solid you are kind of stretched
[29:41] um pretty thin playing on harder
[29:43] difficulties you could really get a
[29:45] struggle as carthage in my opinion but
[29:46] again please do keep in mind
[29:49] this faction overview is under the
[29:50] assumption you're playing on normal
[29:52] difficulty thus
[29:54] you should have some diplomacy options
[29:56] whereas if you're playing on hard or
[29:58] very hard or above
[29:59] diplomacy just goes out the window and
[30:01] everyone's going to declare war on you
[30:03] that's kind of what happens i mean when
[30:05] you're playing his carthage that's very
[30:06] hard to handle but anyway let's go into
[30:09] the part 2 section of this video where
[30:11] we'll check out the navy of the
[30:13] carthaginian roster and the land forces
[30:16] so let's do it
[30:18] alrighty everybody here we are at the
[30:20] naval battle section of this video i
[30:23] know
[30:24] it's pretty rare that we actually cover
[30:26] the navies of
[30:28] uh the factions that we do overview so
[30:30] that's because the majority of factions
[30:32] usually only have about three to like
[30:35] five maybe six ships and it's all like
[30:38] the same kind of unit like an actuator
[30:40] for the barbarians available in like
[30:42] three different ships and maybe like a
[30:45] slinger or something so um carthage
[30:48] isn't amazing with their navy which is
[30:50] kind of surprising since they are
[30:51] carthage
[30:53] renowned for their navy
[30:54] and naval prowess
[30:56] um but they're not bad and so i thought
[30:58] we may as well take at least a couple of
[31:00] minutes out of this overview to check
[31:02] them out i'm not going to go through
[31:04] these stats of every single ship that we
[31:06] have here just going to give you guys
[31:07] some general highlights and a few
[31:09] close-ups of the units so as usual i've
[31:12] split up the
[31:14] um
[31:15] military forces i keep going to say army
[31:17] but this isn't around me this is your
[31:18] navy
[31:19] um i split up your forces into different
[31:22] categories
[31:23] and you can see off the bat you have
[31:25] variety which is very very nice um some
[31:29] navies are focused on melee combat some
[31:32] are focused on ramming others on
[31:34] skirmishing looking at you egypt
[31:36] whereas here's the carthage you have a
[31:38] little bit of everything um you don't
[31:40] have anything that is the best
[31:42] quote-unquote but you do have some very
[31:44] good stuff for example right here we
[31:47] have your marines um and the different
[31:50] ships here don't demonstrate different
[31:52] units they all are the exact same units
[31:54] with the exact same stats
[31:56] the only difference is that
[31:58] um some of these ships are bigger than
[32:01] others and they also have projectile
[32:04] weapons for example
[32:06] um this right here this 140 million
[32:09] um
[32:10] apparently panteras unit or basically
[32:12] your marines that are a 140 men
[32:16] ship health total of 880 which is
[32:18] terrible it's pretty decent um
[32:22] they have a scorpion as you can see
[32:24] right here at the front
[32:25] so they will start to shoot pretty far
[32:27] away unfortunately as you can see here
[32:29] it does not show you the radius
[32:31] of that actual scorpion
[32:34] um so that is going to be a little bit
[32:36] of a hidden way that you could get a few
[32:38] extra kills it won't swing the battling
[32:40] away necessarily but it might kill a few
[32:42] of the enemies marines before they
[32:44] engage with your own thus giving your
[32:46] men the slight edge over the enemy kind
[32:49] of depends on their ships as well um but
[32:52] then we also have the same thing for
[32:53] this tower right here um the tower
[32:56] itself shoots out projectiles and you
[32:58] have a scorpion down below as well so
[33:00] not only are you paying for more men but
[33:02] you also get a bigger ship with more
[33:04] health obviously and you get two sets of
[33:07] projectiles flying out and can we just
[33:09] admire the amazing textures on this ship
[33:12] oh my goodness that looks disgusting
[33:14] that looks
[33:15] terrifying could you imagine that just
[33:17] coming at you
[33:19] head on at your ship like that looks
[33:21] evil dude oh that looks incredible
[33:26] very very nice um the marines themselves
[33:28] also all look pretty badass they're
[33:31] basically the equivalent of
[33:33] almost roman legionnaires really um if
[33:35] we look at their stats
[33:37] this is the stats all of your melee
[33:39] troops use on ships you have a melee
[33:42] attack of 10 a weapon damage at 28
[33:44] merely defense of 16 and then an arm of
[33:47] 35 that armor of 35 is very substantial
[33:51] very strong um and like i said we're
[33:54] getting into legionnaire territory you
[33:56] have the big hoplite style shields you
[33:58] have the carasses you have a little bit
[34:00] of chainmail i believe of some of the
[34:01] men um so
[34:04] your marines while they're not
[34:05] necessarily the best in the world they
[34:07] are very very good
[34:09] um and then comparing your melee troops
[34:11] to roman troops i believe they are the
[34:13] exact same statistically except for one
[34:16] thing which is that the romans have like
[34:18] one extra point of attack
[34:20] um depending on what ship they use but
[34:22] i'm just talking about like this
[34:23] standard roman marines that you will end
[34:25] up fighting
[34:26] um then over here we have another
[34:28] section of just these four ships uh
[34:31] these are your
[34:32] skirmishers you have a javelin ship
[34:35] which only goes up to 80 men funnily
[34:36] enough not sure why that is but it is
[34:38] what it is
[34:39] um you then have the lyric slingers over
[34:42] here and they have the same range as
[34:44] they normally would range at 215.
[34:47] then you have arches two sets of arches
[34:49] both of them are the exact same except
[34:51] for the size of the ship and the men on
[34:53] board
[34:54] um but
[34:55] yeah that's it you can do long range
[34:57] skirmishing with your
[34:59] slingers you can try to draw the enemy
[35:01] away with them you can try to use arches
[35:03] instead uh i typically prefer to use
[35:05] archers but i mean that's just me
[35:08] or you could use close range fast moving
[35:10] skirmishes or javelin of course so
[35:14] very interesting stuff um like i said
[35:16] gives you the option to basically take
[35:18] on the enemy navy how you like we then
[35:21] also have a siege uh you know here only
[35:24] the one um you get it for listening 140
[35:27] men are with this ballistic unit so not
[35:29] only do you have very nice long-range
[35:32] damage potential but you do have
[35:35] marines here they are listed as greek
[35:37] marines which is interesting
[35:39] your other marines are not which is why
[35:41] i believe their statistics are different
[35:43] because these guys have only an armor
[35:45] listed at 30 rather than 35 do they look
[35:48] a little bit more greek than the others
[35:50] now they're looking pretty punic to me
[35:54] so there might be a little bit of an
[35:55] oversight there
[35:56] perhaps they um are supposed to be
[35:59] supposed to be the same as the other
[36:01] cafeteria marines
[36:03] but yeah they are
[36:05] over here on the left side you'll see it
[36:06] says greek marines have brackets and
[36:09] uh yeah only 30 armor instead of 35 but
[36:12] still pretty strong ship not bad at all
[36:14] we didn't have these fire pot ships fire
[36:17] pot ships seem to be very hit or miss to
[36:19] me i'll have them ram the enemy ship
[36:21] multiple times and the fire pots which
[36:23] are dangling right here won't detonate
[36:26] other times they'll wipe out a ship in a
[36:28] single charge so
[36:30] use these at your own discretion it's
[36:32] kind of up to you
[36:34] i don't really recommend them then the
[36:36] other thing we need to talk about is
[36:38] your potential flagships these other
[36:40] ships that your admirals will be using
[36:43] obviously you have three different sets
[36:45] you have one set which is um a archery
[36:48] unit so a little bit more for minor
[36:50] navy's doing patrolling along your crows
[36:52] perhaps you have a scorpion on there
[36:54] we then have your other ship which is
[36:56] kind of the same deal except it has
[36:58] marines instead of arches you have the
[37:00] scorpion again and then we also have the
[37:02] tower that will shoot our projectiles so
[37:04] a little bit more upscale i would
[37:07] recommend you get at least that level
[37:09] but what i really would recommend
[37:11] is getting
[37:12] this big bad boy what a heifer
[37:16] look how big this lad is
[37:18] this is very impressive not only does it
[37:21] look amazing like look at this oh my
[37:23] gosh the detail
[37:25] are you kidding me how old is room 2
[37:27] guys what
[37:32] it's just wow very impressive the dei
[37:35] team has done amazing work i wonder how
[37:36] much of them
[37:38] of their work has gone into the ships
[37:40] but either way i'm just
[37:42] flabbergasted i'm very impressed um but
[37:44] anyway i would recommend this ship
[37:46] because in case you've missed it
[37:48] it is quite clearly your biggest ship
[37:51] um if we bring it over here next to this
[37:53] ship it is similar in size
[37:55] but it is still way bigger
[37:58] uh has a bigger tower has a bigger
[38:00] ship bigger everything and ladies and
[38:02] gentlemen i know it might pain me
[38:05] my pain some of you guys to hear but
[38:06] size does matter and when it comes to
[38:10] navel warfare in the ancient world that
[38:12] is absolutely true because the bigger
[38:14] your ship the more ship health it has
[38:16] the more health it has the more it can
[38:18] withstand
[38:19] obviously having your admiral on a ship
[38:21] like this is going to be extremely
[38:23] important
[38:25] this is the one ship which i think will
[38:27] give you a really big edge over romans
[38:30] when you're fighting them because you
[38:31] have 2 000 hp
[38:34] and you have 180 men on board that is
[38:37] massive
[38:38] this ship can take on multiple at once
[38:40] if needed in terms of boarding actions
[38:43] you might get border from two different
[38:45] sides doesn't matter this ship can
[38:47] handle it
[38:48] it's unlikely that the ai would do that
[38:50] don't get me wrong it's not going to be
[38:52] easy and you shouldn't throw this into
[38:54] melee just kind of carelessly
[38:57] but having a ship with 2 000 hp is very
[39:01] nice not every faction
[39:03] not every faction in the game can say
[39:05] that they have 2000 ship hp i know egypt
[39:08] can i believe some of the docky factions
[39:11] might be able to but i know the romans
[39:13] cannot i believe they max out either
[39:15] 1800 or 1600 which still gives you an
[39:18] edge over them
[39:19] um so this ship is going to be very
[39:21] expensive it will hit your income but in
[39:24] my opinion it is way better to use this
[39:27] than one of these other two smaller
[39:28] ships unless you have like a campaign
[39:30] reason for example you don't have enough
[39:33] money to support a navy
[39:35] around new carthage so perhaps you just
[39:37] want your admiral to use this small ship
[39:39] to try and patrol around make sure the
[39:41] pesky pirates can't raid your cities
[39:43] it's up to you
[39:44] but um that is my opinion on the
[39:47] carthaginian navy overall it's very
[39:49] solid but it's not as amazing as you
[39:51] might think it would be being that this
[39:53] is carthage that's it for the
[39:55] carthaginian naval overview overall
[39:57] looking pretty good um now let's jump on
[40:00] into the land army overview of the
[40:03] carthaginian republic
[40:05] alrighty everybody here we are with the
[40:07] army overview section of this video for
[40:11] carthage we just checked out the navy
[40:13] very briefly and here we are
[40:15] on the battlefield just outside of the
[40:18] city of carthage actually if we go way
[40:20] down here at the bottom of the map
[40:22] um you can see carthage way out here in
[40:24] the distance
[40:25] um so very cool
[40:27] i know some people have requested i try
[40:29] to do prettier battle maps for
[40:32] um these faction overviews i do
[40:34] appreciate the reasoning behind that but
[40:37] what i prefer to do is instead um go to
[40:40] locations
[40:41] uh as close to the capital cities of
[40:44] these uh factions as possible or just in
[40:47] iconic places
[40:48] where they will be fighting and this is
[40:50] obviously in the heartland of carthage
[40:53] um
[40:54] i have been posting on discord a fair
[40:56] bit over the last couple weeks but in
[40:59] case you have missed it i've been
[41:01] relatively sick recently um so if my
[41:04] voice is sounding a little bit more
[41:05] croaky than normal or um if you guys
[41:08] notice that it sounds different in
[41:11] different aspects of the video that's
[41:12] because i've had to record this over
[41:15] several days um i have to record in
[41:18] small segments of like 15 to 30 minutes
[41:20] at a time which is not helpful for a
[41:23] video that's probably going to be well
[41:24] over an hour long
[41:26] although i will try to cut it down but
[41:27] anyway
[41:28] let's move on from that we have a
[41:30] massive roster to get through this isn't
[41:33] even your entire cartridge union roster
[41:35] um
[41:36] obviously it doesn't include aor units
[41:39] you get access to but i had to cut out i
[41:41] believe two unit no three units um two
[41:45] of our elephant units i've had to cut
[41:47] out in addition to a libyan slinger and
[41:51] then i believe a libyan javelin unit as
[41:54] all but those both units were very
[41:56] levied here
[41:58] but
[41:59] i ran out of room to troops that i could
[42:01] have in my army in a battle and that's
[42:03] how i show off these armies to you guys
[42:05] so um you won't be missing anything just
[42:08] a couple levy units and your other
[42:10] variants of the elephants so what i did
[42:13] for the elephants is get you guys the
[42:14] best elephant that carthage can get
[42:17] um but
[42:19] basically the other elephants are the
[42:21] same they just don't have the towers
[42:23] with uh javelin on top so talk about
[42:26] that a little bit more later
[42:28] let's as always
[42:30] um go ahead and start with your generals
[42:32] bodyguard you have
[42:34] many different options as carthage for
[42:36] your bodyguards as you do for your
[42:38] entire roster options options options
[42:41] um however i chose to go with the
[42:43] californian general's bodyguard because
[42:46] it's your most obviously dedicated
[42:47] bodyguard
[42:50] and it's actually really really solid
[42:52] you know i really would recommend you
[42:53] try to use this early on in your
[42:55] campaign you don't necessarily need the
[42:57] sacred band cavalry that you get access
[42:59] to for generals um
[43:01] i believe you get the early two
[43:03] sacrament kev and the later as a general
[43:06] these guys are still excellent only a
[43:08] hundred men in their unit unfortunately
[43:10] but stats across the board are fantastic
[43:14] they are a little bit slower
[43:16] uh than what you might like but that's
[43:17] because they're just so good they're
[43:19] very heavily armored amazing attack and
[43:21] defense good charge
[43:23] um these guys can basically do
[43:25] everything except skirmish
[43:28] um of course um very nice bodyguard to
[43:31] start off with and
[43:32] as per the rest of the car virgilian
[43:35] roster these guys look amazing and
[43:37] you're going to see that as a bit of a
[43:39] pattern throughout the rest of the
[43:40] roster anyway let's look at these
[43:42] skirmishes that carthage has access to
[43:45] okay everybody here we are checking out
[43:47] your skirmishes we have the libyan
[43:49] peltes
[43:50] um
[43:51] pretty low tier but they are still
[43:53] pretty useful and you will have a
[43:55] mercenary variant of these guys as well
[43:57] which is mercenary numidian peltus
[44:00] um
[44:02] these guys are a little bit better in
[44:04] melee attack and defense so you can use
[44:06] them in a fight if you really really
[44:08] need someone but i would try to avoid it
[44:11] um
[44:12] just a little fyi we do have a massive
[44:14] roster so obviously i'm not going to go
[44:16] into too much in depth
[44:18] about every single unit but i will cover
[44:21] units i feel like uh that are worth
[44:23] mentioning
[44:24] um and then here we actually do have the
[44:26] mercenary new minions i forgot that i
[44:28] brought them um we should actually swap
[44:31] these two around
[44:32] because your libyan pelotons are better
[44:35] numidian javelin men aren't as good
[44:38] although i believe we also have a
[44:39] numidian palta specific unit as well
[44:43] um which is a mercenary unit though but
[44:45] these guys
[44:47] uh
[44:49] pretty levy like
[44:51] um unfortunately they don't even have
[44:53] something like stalk ability or anything
[44:55] um and they really attack and defense is
[44:57] pretty abysmal
[44:59] we then have the libby phoenician paltis
[45:02] these guys are really really nice so i
[45:04] really enjoy um using them in online
[45:07] battles i recommend you try to do so as
[45:09] well if you can
[45:11] um just fantastic peltus unit has solid
[45:14] attack and defense it almost acts as
[45:16] like a bit of a theory or spear unit
[45:18] with javelins in a way
[45:20] um especially with that armor of 30.
[45:23] very very juicy
[45:26] mercenary baleric slingers i mean do i
[45:29] need to talk about them they're just
[45:31] some of the best slingers in the game
[45:33] they used to be the best
[45:34] however i think i need to do a best
[45:37] slinger video
[45:38] in dei because a lot of the barbarian
[45:41] factions now have slingers that can
[45:43] rival these guys if not outperform them
[45:46] so i'll need to do some comparisons and
[45:48] see what happens with them
[45:50] but you can get them as a mercenary unit
[45:53] or you can get them as an aor unit so
[45:56] very nice to have the multiple options
[45:58] available to you obviously you need to
[46:01] recruit them from near the balearic
[46:03] islands area though so in western i mean
[46:05] in eastern iberia
[46:07] the western part of your empire though
[46:10] we then have libyan arches
[46:12] libyan arches are your bottom tier arch
[46:15] unit but they are there so it's nice
[46:17] that you do have the option but then you
[46:19] jump up from them
[46:20] to your carthaginian archers these guys
[46:23] are very very nice um the range is
[46:26] amazing just a standard 165
[46:30] but their armor is at 25 an attack of 10
[46:32] defensive 13
[46:34] these guys aren't something to be
[46:37] necessarily underestimated
[46:40] and they have a shield on their back so
[46:42] that will help them in skirmishing
[46:44] against the enemy
[46:45] just overall they're actually quite
[46:47] impressive they will deal some damage
[46:49] mainly use them as a flanking force if
[46:51] you need to use them immediately um but
[46:54] yeah
[46:55] actually quite impressive and it gives
[46:57] you the ability to use flaming shot in
[47:00] combat so that's obviously going to help
[47:02] you out as well um
[47:04] i have once again favorited your
[47:07] different units that will go into
[47:08] different categories so you'll see in
[47:10] the unit cards down here we have number
[47:13] one uh or group one and then group two
[47:15] group one represents all of the units
[47:18] that you get after the furious reforms
[47:21] number two is all of the units you get
[47:23] after the 4x reforms
[47:26] um so carthage
[47:28] adheres to the reforms that the greeks
[47:30] have obviously so you have the
[47:31] ethereum's reforms that will occur for
[47:34] the player and imperium level 3 after
[47:37] you hit turn 50 so you have to be at
[47:39] imperial level three first though and
[47:41] then you uh get the forex reforms at
[47:44] imperium level five after turn 120 so
[47:48] um some of these units won't be
[47:50] available to you until the late game
[47:52] you've got to keep that in mind for
[47:53] example these pelters are one such unit
[47:56] they don't come in until the end and
[47:58] fewer other skirmishes
[48:00] you have the um
[48:03] libyan peltis down here these guys are
[48:06] ethereus units
[48:07] carthaginian archers are also a furious
[48:10] unit
[48:11] but various reforms don't take long
[48:14] and um it's pretty easy to hit imperium
[48:16] level three i think you even start with
[48:18] imperium level 3 is carthage uh it's
[48:21] over three or two if i remember
[48:22] correctly so
[48:24] um
[48:25] while
[48:26] your skirmishers
[48:27] look like there isn't a lot of options
[48:29] you actually do have options you have
[48:31] peltus slingers archers good aor
[48:35] mercenary options and you can even get
[48:36] crossbowmen once you take over sicily if
[48:39] you do want to use them so
[48:40] um don't take this
[48:42] uh
[48:43] relatively small looking size in a
[48:45] negative way
[48:47] it's not really representative of how
[48:49] powerful your skirmishing capabilities
[48:52] can be
[48:53] especially in conjunction with your
[48:55] other
[48:56] more mobile units
[48:58] moving along though we have your
[49:00] spearmint we have a massive contingent
[49:02] of spearmen so what i've done with them
[49:05] is i've divided them into two categories
[49:08] the
[49:08] rear category up here
[49:10] uh let's do a green line
[49:13] uh inside this green circle is units
[49:15] that are just over spearman
[49:17] they are just spearmint that are um
[49:20] basically standard spearmint nothing too
[49:23] fancy about them i mean some of them are
[49:24] excellent some of them are not so much
[49:27] however the section in front represented
[49:30] by the red arrow here
[49:32] is where we have your hoplites so we'll
[49:34] go over the hoplites first and we'll
[49:36] work our way back to your more generic
[49:38] spears
[49:39] um don't take these groups being
[49:42] separated as that the hoplites are
[49:44] better than the others or vice versa
[49:46] they both have their strengths and
[49:47] weaknesses so i just wanted to separate
[49:50] them so you can understand that you do
[49:52] have a pretty vast hoplite contention um
[49:55] so beginning with that we start with
[49:58] your very low tier libyan hoplites and
[50:01] despite them being low tier they're
[50:02] actually very useful they come from your
[50:04] subject social class population
[50:07] so you can get a lot of them very
[50:09] quickly if you want to recruit them from
[50:10] caravaggio from wherever
[50:12] um they will lose to other hoplites for
[50:15] example syracuse and hoplites
[50:17] but put them in the phalanx ability and
[50:19] they will still do very well for you um
[50:22] not as well however as
[50:27] these guys are gonna be hard to kind of
[50:29] maintain as a
[50:31] numerous uh contingent in your armies
[50:34] because they come from your phoenician
[50:36] population which is quite limited
[50:37] throughout your empire you can get them
[50:40] in numbers if you really try and put in
[50:42] effort
[50:43] however as soon as you get them in
[50:45] battle you're going to take casualties
[50:48] and if you're in foreign lands it's
[50:49] going to be hard to replace
[50:51] your phoenician first class soldiers so
[50:55] these guys are fantastic though
[50:58] the stats aren't amazing but for
[50:59] whatever reason they just perform really
[51:01] really really well
[51:02] um i'd like to try and use these guys as
[51:05] a little bit of a elite core or at least
[51:07] a second line core
[51:09] to my army
[51:10] um
[51:12] just really really nice unit and
[51:14] obviously they have the phalanx ability
[51:16] but uh yeah overall quite nice and they
[51:18] have resistance to heat
[51:21] uh they will still take
[51:24] attrition when you go in the desert
[51:25] though unfortunately but they have they
[51:27] have the discipline roll so they will
[51:29] last a very long time as well
[51:31] um so that's always very nice
[51:33] uh jumping up from them though
[51:37] mercenary greek hoplites
[51:39] um these guys are obviously mercenaries
[51:42] and they are greeks despite that
[51:44] um
[51:46] despite that though they do not come
[51:48] from your foreign social class instead
[51:50] they come from your subject social class
[51:52] so because of that you can actually
[51:54] recruit a crap ton of them so if you
[51:57] want to do a hoplite based army try to
[51:59] use these bad boys
[52:02] they are
[52:03] actually technically better than the
[52:04] carthaginians in terms of armor they
[52:07] have 35 compared to 30 and their morale
[52:10] is higher at 46 compared to 39 the
[52:13] carthaginians just didn't have the class
[52:15] that the greeks do at least in mid to
[52:18] or mid to heavy hoplites right here
[52:21] however the carthaginians do take a step
[52:23] back
[52:25] with the libya phoenician peltis um
[52:28] pretty much better across the entire
[52:30] board except for morale and armor
[52:32] compared to the greeks which is the same
[52:34] but all other stats go up
[52:36] for the uh libya phoenicians although
[52:39] they don't have the discipline trait
[52:41] which is interesting and worth noting
[52:44] does it really make a lot of sense since
[52:46] the carthaginians do
[52:48] greeks do but yeah libya phoenicians
[52:50] don't
[52:51] so okay
[52:53] um but they are libby phoenician so
[52:55] because of that they won't come from the
[52:57] phoenician social class they'll be from
[52:59] the labor phoenician mix so your tier
[53:01] two social class um again not going to
[53:04] be available to you in massive numbers
[53:06] but it'll be easier to get than the
[53:08] standard carthaginians however
[53:11] these guys will not be available until
[53:13] your uh first reforms kick in the
[53:16] ethereus reforms
[53:18] um from them
[53:19] we then move up
[53:21] we are at your command to your car
[53:23] virgilian sacred band
[53:25] uh a pretty notorious unit for carthage
[53:28] basically the same stats as the libya
[53:30] phoenician hotline though except their
[53:33] morale is at 52 and they have the um
[53:35] discipline trait
[53:37] again resistant to heat so that's nice i
[53:39] believe all of your units are resistant
[53:41] to heat so it's always a nice little
[53:43] bonus to have
[53:44] um but then
[53:46] just wow they look really really amazing
[53:48] very fun unit to use
[53:50] probably not the most practical
[53:54] you're going to struggle to fill up your
[53:55] armies with them this is basically
[53:59] um
[54:00] when you have too much of a certain type
[54:02] of population and you kind of just want
[54:04] to make a really strong army just for
[54:07] the sake of it
[54:08] however they'll become bed
[54:11] to possibly the best spear unit
[54:14] that the cafeterians can access to now i
[54:16] include these guys here in the hoplite
[54:18] um line because they have the phalanx
[54:21] ability
[54:22] um not a pie core you will note it is an
[54:26] actual phalanx that these guys form
[54:28] despite their shields being different
[54:30] from the standard hopland shield that
[54:32] hoplites use
[54:33] um these guys have incredible stats
[54:36] especially in regards to defense
[54:38] uh fantastic morale at 56 great armor at
[54:41] 38. these guys are your triarii of
[54:44] carthage they will last an insanely long
[54:47] time in a fight
[54:49] they have some nice abilities such as
[54:51] the phalanx ability um
[54:53] discipline formation yet again
[54:56] uh resistant to heat and there was
[54:58] something else um they have the reform
[55:01] the line ability but so do all of your
[55:02] felix units
[55:04] not really a big deal though it's just a
[55:06] kind of minor change that all hoplites
[55:08] have been given in the 1.3 update um but
[55:11] just
[55:12] i could have sworn that these guys used
[55:14] to have these square formation but they
[55:15] definitely don't now for whatever reason
[55:18] but yeah just really really amazing unit
[55:21] looks fantastic and
[55:23] it's very very reliable you're never
[55:26] going to see these guys route easily off
[55:28] the field of battle they will be the
[55:30] last unit in their car forgetting army
[55:32] trying to hold the line
[55:34] against the legions of rome um but
[55:37] that's it for your hot plate specific
[55:39] units or phalanx units we then go up to
[55:41] your standard kind of spearman
[55:44] well you have libyan spearmen you have
[55:46] these guys here and then you also have a
[55:48] furious unit of them
[55:51] um you have mercenary african levies
[55:53] these guys are pretty much the same
[55:55] statistically except no armor
[55:58] but they do have a javelin so you might
[56:00] want to get them just because they have
[56:01] a javelin 300 men per unit so they can
[56:04] slow down the enemy but not for that
[56:06] already
[56:07] here's the libyan theory of speed unit
[56:10] obviously available to you after the
[56:12] serious reforms oh by the way
[56:21] are available only after the thorax
[56:23] reforms as well so keep that in mind
[56:26] libyan ethereum spears pretty solid
[56:28] theriosphere but i mean not as good as
[56:31] other ethereum units they're useful
[56:34] probably would have recommended too
[56:36] highly
[56:37] um but you can use what i would
[56:39] recommend it was trying to get gaelic
[56:40] units
[56:43] so right here we have the mercenary
[56:44] gaelic warriors uh
[56:47] statistically they are actually worse
[56:49] than the libyans technically
[56:52] um
[56:53] that is interesting i wonder why that is
[56:56] let's look at their abilities
[56:59] they do have expert charge defense but
[57:00] so do the furious units
[57:03] they have a javelin so
[57:05] the only possible thing would be
[57:08] um
[57:09] social class but these guys come from
[57:11] the uh
[57:13] crap what is it
[57:14] the subject social class so i'm not too
[57:16] sure why
[57:19] i've put them there they should be
[57:21] technically behind the libyan furious
[57:23] piece actually my mistake
[57:25] only just a minor mistake though these
[57:27] guys are essentially on the same level
[57:30] just a small difference in morale
[57:32] [Music]
[57:33] however we then jump up to the mercenary
[57:35] ligurian spearmen these guys act as
[57:38] ethereal spear unit it's still
[57:40] relatively fast no javelin unfortunately
[57:43] but 300 men per unit and their stats are
[57:45] a little bit more impressive
[57:47] uh especially that armor 20.
[57:50] their attack
[57:51] is slightly increased compared to the
[57:53] last couple speed units the defense is
[57:55] slightly lower just by one
[57:58] um but besides that
[58:01] they have other stats that have gone up
[58:05] and they have that morale of 43 just
[58:06] like the libyan theory of speed units so
[58:09] it's up to you if you want to have a
[58:10] javelin or not in your ethereal style
[58:12] unit
[58:13] definitely look like ligurian units so i
[58:16] really love that not only do they look
[58:17] celtic but they look like ligurians
[58:21] often using these small little british
[58:24] slush german khanda army helmets or that
[58:27] i guess that's more like a british style
[58:29] that one
[58:30] maybe that one's a little bit more
[58:31] german looking but um
[58:34] uh you know what i mean with these
[58:35] shields though they have these very
[58:37] interesting shape shields you could
[58:39] almost call it a rectangle except it
[58:40] kind of goes off to the left and right
[58:42] side like that
[58:43] i can't think of the name of the shape
[58:45] that you would call it but anyway
[58:47] ligurians are definitely quite iconic
[58:50] when it comes to the celts
[58:52] we then have mercenary naked spears
[58:55] throwers um
[58:57] very ferocious in a defense with a
[59:00] defensive 23 which is kind of surprising
[59:02] it's not what you would expect from a
[59:03] unit like this unfortunately because
[59:06] they are naked they don't have any armor
[59:08] so they will die quite quickly
[59:10] especially skirmisher fire
[59:12] they do um
[59:13] have an immune interfere ability so you
[59:16] can't really scare them off the field
[59:18] and
[59:19] um
[59:21] at the beginning of the battle when they
[59:23] are uh eager to fight when they're not
[59:25] tired at all they are impetuous so
[59:27] they'll have a little bit extra morale
[59:29] which is always nice um i'm not really
[59:32] sure what their purpose is other than to
[59:34] reflect carpets getting more gallic
[59:36] units i really would like it if they had
[59:38] perhaps a fear ability to where they
[59:41] instill fear in the enemy um that or
[59:43] perhaps try to boost their attack a
[59:45] little bit but i mean the stats are
[59:47] still great 62 morales pretty fanatical
[59:50] um defense at 23 attack of 10
[59:53] maybe their charge bonus could be
[59:55] increased to 26 maybe 28 something like
[59:58] that kind of reflect
[60:00] their charge style of warfare
[60:03] command
[60:04] we then have libya phoenician theory of
[60:06] spears now despite these guys being
[60:08] listed as furious spears
[60:10] the dei website lists these guys as a
[60:13] forex reform unit i'm not entirely sure
[60:16] which one is correct but either way you
[60:18] do have to wait until at least the
[60:20] furious reforms to get them
[60:22] if not
[60:23] quite possibly after these forex reforms
[60:26] whenever you do get these guys though
[60:28] they are very very nice very good solid
[60:31] uh inferior style unit
[60:33] 30 armor all have a javelin 300 men
[60:36] just very solid
[60:39] this is this is the kind of furious unit
[60:41] you want in your army so
[60:43] use these guys on the flanks of your
[60:45] army you can even form a battle line if
[60:47] you really want to use a lot of spearmen
[60:50] um just excellent very very nice good to
[60:53] use for online battles too
[60:55] however we're going to jump up to some
[60:57] really elite stuff we then have the
[60:59] mercenary heavy galaxy now these guys
[61:02] don't require reforms to get to so you
[61:04] might want to use these guys
[61:06] before the others um but they are
[61:08] mercenaries you get them through your
[61:10] mercenary barracks you have
[61:13] pretty freaking fantastic stats across
[61:15] the entire board comparing them to your
[61:17] furious unit you have eight more armor
[61:19] no javelin
[61:20] um they are slower because of their
[61:22] heavy armor but their attack is at eight
[61:24] defense at 19.
[61:26] charge bonus is kind of low at only 19
[61:28] though
[61:29] but
[61:30] just wow very very solid unit
[61:33] 200 men per unit though so you do see
[61:36] that go down compared to 300 but you
[61:39] also get a lot of extra armor
[61:41] and some extra defense so
[61:44] kind of depends on the situation having
[61:46] 300 men in a good unit is very nice but
[61:49] these guys are also very nice i kind of
[61:51] like to see them have one javelin to be
[61:53] honest
[61:54] um
[61:55] because
[61:57] they're not
[61:58] i mean they're really good unit but
[62:00] they're not amazing i think one javelin
[62:02] would be fair to them
[62:04] but i mean that's just my kind of
[62:06] opinion on on the subject
[62:08] we then of course have the libby
[62:10] phoenician forex spears um
[62:13] excellent spamming unit very close to
[62:16] the uh
[62:18] sacred band unit they were looking at
[62:19] earlier
[62:20] but they're just
[62:22] still on a
[62:24] level behind the sacred band especially
[62:26] in terms of
[62:28] morale being at 49 compared to 56 they
[62:31] do have the same armor um the attack of
[62:33] the uh thor experiences behind
[62:36] the sacred band as is the attack
[62:40] just yeah very close to rivaling how
[62:42] good the um
[62:44] sacred band is but the sacrament is more
[62:46] of a hoplite unit whereas these guys are
[62:48] a little bit more mobile and they have
[62:50] the hollow square formation
[62:53] so that will help them against enemy
[62:55] cavalry and just be more defensive in
[62:57] general
[62:58] and they have the defensive
[63:00] formation ability i don't really
[63:03] recommend using the defensive formation
[63:05] unless you really really need extra
[63:06] morale and defense
[63:08] but it surrounds your troops or allows
[63:10] your troops to be surrounded very easy
[63:13] in a one-on-one
[63:14] engagement um
[63:16] especially if you're facing a
[63:18] barbarian sword unit that has like 300
[63:21] men so
[63:22] you really need to be in the right
[63:23] position for that defensive formation to
[63:25] not bite you in the butt but otherwise
[63:28] just fantastic unit another unit that
[63:30] you'll be wanting to use agarami's on
[63:32] the flanks um you could even provide a
[63:35] decent main front line with that as well
[63:37] and they will last a very very very long
[63:40] time through that
[63:42] defensive around so
[63:44] uh and the armor the hammer being at 38
[63:47] is pretty amazing so that's all of your
[63:49] spears a lot of options in the spear
[63:50] department obviously um now we'll move
[63:53] up to your swordsman
[63:55] and your swordsman um
[63:58] starting to take up a lot of time now so
[64:00] i'll just kind of glance over your
[64:01] swordsman as quick as i can we have some
[64:04] libyan infantry swordsmen basically
[64:06] levies
[64:07] mercenary iberian swordsmen um kind of
[64:10] deceptive in how they are kind of
[64:12] considered good but also not really they
[64:15] do have some gorilla deployment they do
[64:16] not have the stalk ability though they
[64:18] can hide in grass and they can hide in
[64:20] scrub and forest so
[64:22] they can be stealthy but no stalkability
[64:25] kind of it makes it a little bit
[64:27] deceptive their defense is really bad so
[64:29] don't expect them to last for long i
[64:31] don't recommend you use them a lot in
[64:33] your armies but they do have a javelin
[64:35] we then have the mercenary scutari
[64:37] swordsman fantastic sort of unit
[64:40] unfortunately only 200 men per unit but
[64:42] again we have guerrilla deployment um
[64:45] they can hide fairly well as well a
[64:47] javelin each and just stats are very
[64:50] very solid
[64:51] um and you don't have to wait until you
[64:53] get to the 4x reforms to get them so you
[64:56] may as well try to get them as quick as
[64:57] you can and use them in conjunction with
[65:00] your other mercenary units
[65:02] just really solid and going to be very
[65:04] helpful
[65:05] against greek factions i'm not sure how
[65:08] well they'll perform against rome though
[65:10] as um i'm not too sure about all of your
[65:12] swords but
[65:13] i mean it is nice to have swords to
[65:15] outflank the uh roman legionnaires and
[65:18] deal some damage from
[65:20] behind we then move on to your libyan
[65:23] theorios infantry um these guys are
[65:25] actually way behind
[65:27] those mercenaries guitarists
[65:30] should be kind of towards
[65:32] at the end but a little bit further on
[65:35] yeah let's move these two units
[65:37] scootari over there
[65:39] these two units in here
[65:41] um
[65:43] libyan ethereum's infantry basically
[65:45] stereo swords but only 15 armor we then
[65:48] compare that to the libby
[65:50] uh phoenician furious infantry despite
[65:53] it saying theories again this unit is
[65:55] listed as being a 4x reform unit and i
[65:58] kind of believe it because their armor
[65:59] is at 30. so i would expect these bad
[66:02] boys to be available
[66:04] after the thorax reforms but when they
[66:06] do come in um they're very uniform very
[66:10] disciplined and
[66:11] basically they're going to make a
[66:13] excellent addition to any cafeterian
[66:15] army
[66:17] then jump up to the libya phoenician
[66:19] farax swords these guys are the ones
[66:21] that will go head to head against roman
[66:23] legionnaires um they're equipped in the
[66:26] roman legionnaire style so basically
[66:28] these are the swordsmen that hannibal
[66:30] relied on to hold the line at can i at
[66:33] the end of the battle or towards the end
[66:35] of the battle as he kept them in reserve
[66:38] these libyan phoenicians
[66:40] are excellent
[66:42] absolutely gobsmacking excellent very
[66:44] very nice unit their main downfall
[66:46] though is the lack of a charge so i
[66:48] wouldn't worry too much about getting
[66:49] them into a charge and they don't have
[66:52] any formation but they do have the
[66:53] discipline abilities so that will help
[66:56] them out
[66:57] we then get to your best aggressive
[67:00] swords when these are more of your best
[67:02] shock infantry really um mercenary
[67:04] iberian champions
[67:06] just look at those face masks and body
[67:08] armor wow pretty badass um
[67:12] disgusting melee attack of 18
[67:15] absolutely monstrous attack attack
[67:18] the defense is quite low at nine
[67:20] although not too terrible charge bonus
[67:22] is only 19 now which is kind of
[67:24] confusing to me i think they should be
[67:25] way higher on the charge bonus they're a
[67:28] shock inventory unit at least they come
[67:29] off as that way so
[67:31] i think they should be either given more
[67:33] charge bonus to reflect that or increase
[67:35] their defense slightly um give them a 10
[67:38] or 11 perhaps
[67:39] weapon damage as well i mean i would
[67:42] bump it up to at least a 28 maybe a
[67:44] little bit more they do have the
[67:46] armor-piercing damage as well but
[67:48] i don't know
[67:50] i would kind of like to see them be a
[67:52] little bit more focused towards being a
[67:54] shock infantry in it
[67:57] and again we do have the guerrilla
[67:58] deployment ability but no stalk ability
[68:01] although they can hide relatively well
[68:04] if they are hidden
[68:05] um as in
[68:07] if they are sitting still and hidden so
[68:10] fantastic looking unit very useful but
[68:13] again be aware of their armor piercing
[68:15] is not very high nor is their charge
[68:17] bonus so
[68:18] um try to give them some protection and
[68:21] let them get into a grind
[68:22] against the roman legionnaires if you
[68:24] can although the roman legionnaire armor
[68:27] will help them survive against them
[68:29] anyway that's it for your infantry let's
[68:32] try to get onto your cavalry and then
[68:33] we'll talk about your chariots and
[68:35] elephants
[68:36] sophia cavalry we start off with the
[68:39] carthaginian citizen cavalry um these
[68:42] guys are actually shock cavalry uh
[68:44] believe it or not
[68:45] um some people use them and don't really
[68:48] realize that they are specifically just
[68:51] shock cavalry but
[68:53] it is something to be aware of
[68:54] especially in online battles i've seen
[68:56] some people use these guys and kind of
[68:58] throw them away
[68:59] because they don't realize their defense
[69:01] is pathetic at only four
[69:03] so
[69:04] that's really really low way too low in
[69:07] my opinion it shouldn't be that low
[69:09] i mean i understand why they keep it
[69:11] that low but i think it'll give him at
[69:13] least a six seven or an eight
[69:16] i mean eight might be a bit much kind of
[69:18] more intimately cab territory but
[69:21] man just
[69:22] the rest of this that's so good it's
[69:24] such a shame to see their defense be so
[69:26] low
[69:27] because they're not a lancer unit they
[69:29] don't have a lance they have a long
[69:31] spear that they use in combat
[69:33] but they don't have a lot a caveat that
[69:35] does have a lance though is their
[69:37] brothers the cafeterian citizen
[69:40] late cavalry version um these guys do
[69:43] quite clearly have atlanta you can see
[69:45] um
[69:46] statistically they're a little bit more
[69:48] aggressive
[69:49] um just better all around pretty much
[69:52] everywhere and they also have the
[69:53] discipline
[69:54] uh ability down here
[69:57] so the morale is very good and they will
[70:00] be less likely to rat off the
[70:02] battlefield so
[70:03] thick cartoons shock cavalry is one of
[70:05] the downfalls of carthage they don't
[70:07] have a lot they obviously have this
[70:10] elephants and chariots so you know it's
[70:12] not like they're struggling in shock um
[70:14] but it is worth mentioning like the
[70:16] diadoke factions will have better shock
[70:18] captaining um as will some of the
[70:20] barbarians in eastern factions so that's
[70:23] something to consider in online battles
[70:25] and when you're getting a little bit
[70:26] later into your campaign and if you
[70:29] don't have elephant sig around me for
[70:30] whatever reason but that's it uh for
[70:32] your shock cavalry department come all
[70:35] right we'll be volunteering melee
[70:37] cavalry department um we have some
[70:39] mercenary iberian cav
[70:41] very solid despite it being a low tier
[70:44] kind of unit definitely very good for
[70:46] scouting and it can be useful for online
[70:48] battles as well 120 men is nothing to
[70:52] scoff at and these guys are well armored
[70:53] at 23 so
[70:55] overall not bad give them a little bit
[70:56] of experience and they can be a force to
[70:58] be reckoned with
[71:00] we then have the libyan cavalry which
[71:02] actually have less armor and morale um
[71:05] but they have higher defense at 11.
[71:08] so these guys are kind of equal
[71:10] although the libyans also have 120 men
[71:13] and they have a resistance to heat
[71:14] whereas the iberians do not
[71:17] but then we jump up
[71:19] to the libya phoenician cavalry um armor
[71:22] is disgusting at 38 that's just
[71:24] atrociously very very good for a melee
[71:28] cav unit especially just like not an
[71:30] elite unit but you know pretty um high
[71:33] tier one
[71:34] uh attack is not amazing at nine but
[71:37] it's still good defense at 15. they have
[71:39] a great charge at 48 for being just a
[71:41] melee cab unit
[71:43] and their morale is at 49 so these guys
[71:45] will last quite a while in combat
[71:48] um looking very very good of course
[71:51] libby phoenicians so these guys do come
[71:53] from your furious reforms as you pretty
[71:56] much all your libya finishing units i
[71:58] don't believe
[71:59] any of these others do um here crafty
[72:02] duty and citizen lake have come from
[72:04] your furious reform student that's the
[72:06] cavalry unit that uses a lance so sorry
[72:08] about that forgot to mention it
[72:10] what about your swords
[72:12] did i mention it i don't think i did
[72:14] actually so let's just
[72:16] go over that very quickly
[72:18] libyan ethereal swords obviously come
[72:20] from libyan theorists reforms
[72:23] your libyan phoenician uh furious
[72:25] infantry company of forex reforms
[72:27] and then your libya phoenician uh florax
[72:30] swords obviously come from your forex
[72:32] reforms as well just wanted to clarify
[72:35] that um but anyway
[72:37] getting back to your calvary libya
[72:39] phoenicians come from furious reforms
[72:42] you then have the carthaginian sacred
[72:44] band cavalry excellent high tier melee
[72:46] cave unit although the stats aren't all
[72:49] that much better than the um phoenician
[72:52] libyan mix that you have
[72:54] the main difference being that their
[72:55] armor is at 48 compared to
[72:58] 45 compared to 38 sorry so they are
[73:01] going to be slower but they're going to
[73:02] be harder to kill
[73:04] um so
[73:06] definitely worth trying to get those in
[73:07] your armies you then have the
[73:09] carthaginian circuit
[73:11] late version um
[73:14] barely just a couple
[73:16] uh stats difference between them does it
[73:18] really matter which one you want to use
[73:21] i mean you may as well get the late
[73:22] version why not
[73:24] um but kind of depends on your
[73:27] economy differences
[73:29] however the late variant only comes
[73:31] after the forex reforms
[73:34] but then we have your mercenary iberian
[73:37] heavy cav
[73:38] and now these guys
[73:40] while they don't have the same armor as
[73:43] actually no they have better armor sorry
[73:44] forgot about that they have the best
[73:47] armor out of all of your other cab units
[73:49] that we've just covered
[73:50] and their attacker defense is very very
[73:53] good
[73:54] i'm not really lacking in any department
[73:56] acceptability so they don't have
[73:57] discipline or um resistance to heat
[74:01] and they are kind of slow
[74:04] but man these guys are very heavy if you
[74:06] get them in a melee engagement and get
[74:08] seven cavalry they will do
[74:10] very nice things for you but they're
[74:12] quite expensive
[74:14] and so especially in something like
[74:16] online battle hard to get a lot of
[74:19] but if you can get just one or even two
[74:21] of them
[74:22] they
[74:23] man they can really swing the cavalry
[74:25] engagement in your favor
[74:27] just fantastic
[74:28] heavy unit
[74:30] um
[74:31] and so quite obviously carthage favors
[74:33] having melee cavalry units rather than
[74:36] shock
[74:37] in addition to rather than having
[74:39] skirmishing cab which is kind of
[74:41] confusing because in the median cavalry
[74:43] of kaffir just so famous
[74:47] you really just get the one version i
[74:49] mean there is another version that's
[74:50] available um if you recruit them from
[74:53] the media itself and
[74:55] in your african province
[74:57] you can get a i believe it's an aor
[74:59] variant of these guys
[75:01] um
[75:02] but
[75:04] i mean
[75:05] these guys are very good but at the same
[75:08] time i feel like they're a little bit
[75:09] overrated
[75:10] i mean they have a crap ton of abilities
[75:12] which is very nice they have snipe
[75:14] abilities so they can throw javelins
[75:16] while hidden although it's unlikely
[75:18] they're going to be hidden while they're
[75:19] on horseback
[75:20] do you have the stalk ability the only
[75:23] unit in your army that does so so they
[75:25] can move around the battlefield without
[75:27] being seen so that would make them very
[75:29] nice
[75:30] um another kind of hidden thing about
[75:32] them though is that they have the ignore
[75:35] terrain ability where they have speed
[75:36] penalties caused by terrain
[75:39] uh ignored so they can move as fast as
[75:41] they like anywhere on the battlefield so
[75:45] that's very nice
[75:46] gorilla deployment is very nice and they
[75:48] have the numidian horse one of the best
[75:50] horses in the game
[75:52] they aren't very big though
[75:55] uh in addition the midian's have no
[75:58] armor and armor of four so basically
[76:00] none
[76:01] so you're really relying on hit-and-run
[76:03] tactics from them you need to basically
[76:06] have them avoid taking any damage
[76:09] otherwise they're gonna die quite
[76:10] quickly so
[76:12] you can't really use them in melee
[76:13] engagements and expect them to do well
[76:15] at least not without throwing all their
[76:17] javelins first and they start off with
[76:19] an ammunition of nine javelins that is a
[76:21] fair bit but
[76:23] still um
[76:25] 120 men naked on horseback are not going
[76:27] to do well in melee they will do well in
[76:30] skirmishing though so
[76:31] really make sure you're using them in
[76:33] the appropriate manner but that's it for
[76:35] your cavalry um
[76:37] let's very quickly check out your
[76:38] chariots
[76:40] chariots still very hit or miss um
[76:45] carthage does have the scythe version as
[76:47] you can see right here so kind of like
[76:49] pontus which is nice although these guys
[76:51] are very expensive
[76:53] still very very fragile as well
[76:56] and they don't have a second band in the
[76:58] chariot so they won't have any
[77:00] skirmishing potential
[77:02] but they do have four horses and they
[77:05] are being pulled by
[77:07] with
[77:08] two
[77:09] sipes on either side so
[77:11] they can do massive damage just like
[77:13] elephants can but
[77:15] these guys are gonna be way more fragile
[77:17] than elephants and i wouldn't bother
[77:19] using them against a player to be honest
[77:21] what i would use though is elephants
[77:24] [Music]
[77:26] you have the californian atlas elephants
[77:28] you have three variants of them these
[77:30] guys are the best because they are the
[77:31] only variant that comes with a tower a
[77:34] javelin mid on top so that will get you
[77:36] basically 50 extra kills or so per
[77:38] battle
[77:40] um
[77:41] these guys are a little bit extra
[77:42] armored too with the armor around the
[77:44] head
[77:46] you have the second variant of the
[77:47] elephants that have the same armor but
[77:49] the first variant of the elephants is
[77:51] literally just a naked elephant with a
[77:53] rider on top
[77:55] so
[77:56] if you can try to get this unit just
[77:58] because it will give you a little bit
[77:59] more bang for your buck a little bit
[78:01] more kills
[78:02] i mean but overall the african elephants
[78:05] for carthage are not very good because
[78:07] they're not very big
[78:08] um at least not as far as elephants go
[78:10] there i mean they'll still be very
[78:12] helpful
[78:13] but if you put these up against
[78:15] indian elephants or syrian elephants
[78:17] these guys will get romper stomped
[78:19] um but if you use them the way you
[78:22] should which is to
[78:23] recharge enemy blob formations or at
[78:26] least disrupt them before you charge in
[78:29] then you will do very well on charge and
[78:31] get a lot of kills so
[78:33] um both of these units can be quite
[78:35] helpful
[78:37] i personally prefer using elephants but
[78:40] if you're just doing like a single
[78:41] player campaign you may as well try the
[78:44] chariots out once or twice just to see
[78:46] how long they last to get around me
[78:48] but again very expensive and still very
[78:51] fragile so be aware that try to let them
[78:54] not take too much damage but anyway
[78:57] that's it for the part two section of
[78:59] this video finally so let's very very
[79:02] quickly cover the verdict of carthage
[79:04] because this video has been way too long
[79:05] already
[79:07] and then we'll end it there so i'll see
[79:08] you guys at the verdict
[79:12] okay everybody here we are the part
[79:14] three section of this video where we'll
[79:16] check out the verdict for carthage i'll
[79:18] make some final few noteworthy points
[79:21] about the faction and then we'll give
[79:23] the overall difficulty reading
[79:26] um so first off you are the arch rival
[79:29] of rome the majority of your early to
[79:32] mid and often your late uh campaign uh
[79:36] or errors of your campaign will revolve
[79:38] around dealing with rome and rome's
[79:40] allies um
[79:42] rome is going to be very strong very
[79:44] hard for you to beat
[79:45] you can try to rush them if you like and
[79:47] if you want a very easy campaign rushing
[79:50] the capital so taking rome itself and at
[79:54] the very least liberating it or wiping
[79:56] it out whatever you want to do to it
[79:58] will give you a massive edge over taking
[80:00] on rome as a faction in the future
[80:03] however
[80:04] it's not necessarily easy to try and
[80:06] rush to capital and i wouldn't recommend
[80:08] it it ruins a lot of the fun
[80:11] but just do keep in mind
[80:13] despite
[80:14] total war games allowing a lot of
[80:16] freedom of choice
[80:17] in total wolverine 2 and in dei
[80:20] especially carthage is kind of forced
[80:23] into war with rome at least at some
[80:25] point you're a campaign
[80:27] you also need to consider the fact that
[80:29] you need to beat them to other areas of
[80:31] the mediterranean for example they will
[80:33] go to greece very very quickly once they
[80:35] beat emperors you can't really beat them
[80:37] to it unless you really try so i
[80:40] wouldn't bother but you what you might
[80:41] want to try to beat them to is iberia or
[80:44] perhaps even trying to beat them into
[80:46] northern italy if you want a foothold
[80:49] on some land territory close to italy
[80:51] trying to invade the po valley area
[80:53] before they do such as entering
[80:55] via liguria uh might be a good idea for
[80:58] you if you do want to kind of landlock
[81:00] italy or the romans in i'm not going to
[81:03] be easy mind you but it is possible
[81:07] however despite this you are in a pretty
[81:09] safe position at least strategically you
[81:11] are you have your navy protecting your
[81:14] core territory your navy while it's not
[81:17] the best in the entire campaign it is
[81:19] still solid it's better than the roman
[81:21] navy in a at least early on it is as the
[81:24] romans get more reforms they will get
[81:26] stronger overall so watch out for that
[81:29] but your ships are bigger and
[81:30] constructed better use that to your
[81:32] advantage and try to use your navy to
[81:35] destroy their armies because often the
[81:37] ai will not escort their armies with
[81:39] navies and then that's going to be an
[81:41] easy win for you you can wipe out an
[81:44] entire army for literally zero losses
[81:47] however because you are in the position
[81:50] you are you are also very decentralized
[81:53] you're prone to being drawn into wars on
[81:55] multiple fronts for example
[81:57] probably within the first five to ten
[81:59] turns you will have war in sicily africa
[82:03] and potentially towards iberia as well
[82:06] kind of depends on how you play things
[82:08] who you get uh trade agreements with and
[82:10] what not but you do have factions that
[82:13] are very prone to attacking you sereneca
[82:16] is a bit of a surprise one uh the
[82:18] garamondeans to your southeast are also
[82:20] very prone to attacking you and they
[82:22] will cause you issues you can't ignore
[82:24] them rome is obviously a big one
[82:26] syracuse will also want to declare war
[82:28] on you and if you're playing as the
[82:30] american faction all of these factions
[82:32] will have diplomatic penalties against
[82:34] you so they're not going to like you
[82:36] unless you can kind of convince them
[82:38] to like you so you'll see the same thing
[82:41] in iberia and most of the iberians do
[82:43] not like you and as a result you may see
[82:45] wars develop very quickly especially if
[82:48] you're playing on hard difficulty or
[82:50] above and then there's one last final
[82:52] point that i think some people may not
[82:54] consider but it could really help you
[82:57] out in the long run and that is i think
[83:00] you should consider ignoring sicily
[83:03] entirely
[83:05] um if you don't take it the romans won't
[83:08] come and knock on your doorstep as
[83:10] quickly as they otherwise would uh
[83:12] they'll still declare war on you and
[83:14] still send armies and fleets overseas
[83:16] but it will take a lot longer and if you
[83:18] don't have a landmass connected to rome
[83:20] in some way
[83:22] because sicily is connected to rome they
[83:24] have a land crossing
[83:26] in the northeastern tip of sicily to
[83:28] italy um
[83:30] the romans will struggle to try and
[83:32] pinpoint where they want to attack you
[83:33] so you'll see their armies coming from
[83:35] very far away you'll see them trying to
[83:38] sail across the sea towards corsica and
[83:40] sardinia sometimes to africa or
[83:42] typically they'll try to take your
[83:44] islands first um
[83:46] so leaving sicily alone while it isn't
[83:48] great to lose those two cities there
[83:51] it's not the worst thing in the world
[83:52] and if you do
[83:54] leave sicily alone you can then land
[83:56] lock these sicilian factions into sicily
[83:59] use your better navy to lock them in
[84:01] and basically stone wall the romans and
[84:04] allow you time to either dedicate your
[84:06] armies elsewhere into africa and iberia
[84:08] or just give you time to build tall you
[84:11] might want to do that you already have
[84:12] plenty of territory as it is you need a
[84:14] lot of time and money to build it up to
[84:17] get you into a very powerful position
[84:19] so it's just something that is worth
[84:21] considering and i know a lot of people
[84:23] who play room 2 don't really like the
[84:26] idea of ever losing a war despite many
[84:29] of us wanting more difficulty losing a
[84:31] war typically means that you either lose
[84:33] a campaign or you lose a lot of
[84:35] territory in this instance it's not
[84:38] really necessary because you're crafty
[84:39] you have a lot to lose so that's okay
[84:42] let a little bit of it go you can always
[84:45] come back later on and retake certain uh
[84:47] losses
[84:49] and it kind of gives into a little bit
[84:50] of historical accuracy as well because
[84:53] carthage did eventually lose sicily um
[84:56] in the first initial engagements against
[84:58] rome
[84:59] so anyway ladies and gentlemen after
[85:01] considering this very long faction
[85:03] overview and all of my points pros and
[85:05] cons of carthage
[85:07] and in also reviewing the previous
[85:09] faction overview i did for carthage
[85:11] we're coming in with a difficulty
[85:13] reading which i'm bumping up a little
[85:15] bit just by two points from the previous
[85:17] reading to a total of five out of ten i
[85:21] think carthage is a very average
[85:23] difficulty rating faction it has its
[85:26] pros it has its cons it can potentially
[85:29] be a pretty easy campaign and it can
[85:31] potentially be a very hellish campaign
[85:33] it can be very difficult
[85:35] and that really just depends on how the
[85:37] ai
[85:39] reacts to and how they target you
[85:41] carthaginian campaigns are very
[85:43] versatile and
[85:45] while you'll see some similar patterns
[85:48] it also kind of depends on how well the
[85:50] ai
[85:51] handles fighting
[85:53] so for example playing against uh like
[85:56] the iberians the iberians might just
[85:58] send one army against you and then let
[86:00] you busy fighting with each other so
[86:02] though even though you've had three or
[86:04] four iberian factions declare war on you
[86:06] might not be the end of the world
[86:08] but
[86:09] if they aren't fighting each other then
[86:11] you're in some serious trouble you're
[86:13] going to lose your iberian positions
[86:15] very quickly and then they'll start
[86:17] invading
[86:18] the mauritanian region
[86:20] so
[86:21] it really just depends on so many kind
[86:23] of small factors that combine into
[86:26] giving this overall difficulty rating in
[86:28] my opinion um you do have really big
[86:30] advantages as well like i said you can
[86:33] keep roma bay with your navy for a long
[86:35] time not forever mind you they will
[86:37] catch up to you in terms of naval
[86:39] supremacy
[86:40] but
[86:41] you can keep them at bay and you can get
[86:43] a lot of very big victories very very
[86:46] easily i'd really like to know what you
[86:48] guys think of carthage in its current
[86:50] state is there any changes that you
[86:52] would like to see for carthage if so
[86:54] comment them down below and i would love
