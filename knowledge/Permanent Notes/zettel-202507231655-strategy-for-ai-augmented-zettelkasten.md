# Strategy for an AI-Augmented Zettelkasten

Integrating AI into a Zettelkasten requires a deliberate strategy that enhances productivity without sacrificing privacy, user control, or the serendipity of manual discovery. The goal is to create a system where AI acts as a capable assistant, not an autonomous author.

## Guiding Principles

1.  **Prioritize Privacy with a Hybrid AI Model:** A hybrid approach is essential. Use local LLMs (e.g., via Ollama) for processing all sensitive or private content, ensuring data never leaves the local machine. Cloud-based models can be used for non-sensitive, high-powered tasks like general research or brainstorming.

2.  **AI as an Assistant, Not an Autocrat:** The user must always remain in control. AI should *suggest* tags, links, and connections, but never apply them without explicit user approval. This preserves the integrity of the knowledge base and the user's role as the primary thinker.

3.  **Preserve Serendipity:** While AI is excellent at finding explicit connections, it's crucial to leave space for manual linking and exploration. The system should encourage manual review to foster the unexpected, serendipitous connections that are a hallmark of the Zettelkasten method.

## Key AI Applications

-   **Auto-Tagging:** Use AI to analyze a note's content and suggest a list of relevant tags. This speeds up the organization process while keeping the user in the loop for final approval.
-   **Connection Discovery:** Employ AI to scan the vault and suggest potential links between the current note and existing permanent notes, helping to surface non-obvious relationships.
-   **Content Refinement:** Leverage AI for specific tasks like summarizing long articles, rephrasing unclear sentences, or expanding on a brief idea.

## Implementation Roadmap

1.  **Establish a Local LLM Environment:** Research and install a local LLM provider like Ollama to serve as the foundation for private AI tasks.
2.  **Develop Task-Specific Prompts:** Create a library of prompt templates tailored for different note-processing tasks (e.g., `prompt-for-tagging.md`, `prompt-for-linking.md`).
3.  **Pilot Program:** Test the AI-assisted workflows on a small, controlled sample of notes to evaluate their effectiveness and refine the process before a full rollout.
