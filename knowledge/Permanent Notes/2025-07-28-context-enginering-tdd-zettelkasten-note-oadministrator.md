## Thought  
Vibe coding my own note organization tool, that maintains the meta data, helps me promote ntoes and bridge notes with links to each other. my end goal is to journal my vibe code.

This connects to my broader thinking about [[zettel-202507231648-context-engineering-improves-tdd-automation]] and the importance of context in automation workflows.

## Context  
Reflection while working on Phase 5 AI features for the InnerOS Zettelkasten. Related to concepts in [[zettel-202507231655-strategy-for-ai-augmented-zettelkasten]].
