## Thought  
Pornography has been a problem on the Internet for a long time now with the new law coming into play in the UK around age restriction. This will start age trend worldwide, where we start adopting more age verification to claim adulthood specifically on poor active websites, the time of adding your ID documentation or some sort of verification is not new technology, but in the, never changing changing aspects of the Internet and data and privacy. We are going to see changes in how we authenticate and verify that adults are adults. 

This is going to be great for website like social media, Facebook, Reddit, discord and other websites so that they will have adult only sections, but also block children from seeing harmful content that can be destructive or negative to the well-being of a child

Although on the opposite side of the fence, we are finding that age verification and ID verification, will impede on peoples ability to anonymously access information online and every adult has every right to access and might not want anyone else to knowing that they're consuming so just pornography. This could also be for any political reasons not to out themselves.

Although there's a lot of recent changes around legislation and 80 verification and ID verification on the Internet in the western world, specifically America and Britain, you can find examples of countries where they implement a more draconian approach to making sure that certain groups are not in gaming. Suggest in China and South Korea, where China has limits on how much gaming you are allowed to have on websites if you're under the age of a certain age in South Korea has your Social Security card number as a form of verifying their identity is required for almost any account they want to open on the Internet

Some other technologies that are coming out there to verify your age outside of just giving your government identification is how old is your evil address as one way to calculate how old you are another estimation service is to use someone's age from a selfie or a video

Another issue of this is the potential risk of having such information on the Internet and also other privacy issues that come with accessing certain websites

Question is whether there will be a theater bridge connected to verification it's one
[[“The question isn't whether there will be a data breach connected to age verification, it's when”]]

Currently pornographic websites are fitting on the age verification, probably due to cost, and also it would impact their bottom line of how many viewers are actually on the website which could be astronomically eye-opening

Also, there is also technology that minimize a lot of these rest such as that, even holding onto the data anywhere and getting rid of it as soon as it used

Also, many people can just get around the system by using someone else's account, which is something that is very common today

Another thing is people are going to use VPN more and more to circumvent these kind of cake keeps
