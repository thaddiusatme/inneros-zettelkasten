## Thought  


## Context  
• **Knowing your self-worth**: It's a misconception that the only way to win your first job is to bid the lowest rate. You should charge what you're worth, as not every client is trying to take advantage of you. For example, the creator stated his first job was $25 an hour, but he believes he should have started at $50 per hour for his skill set.

• **Great portfolios win jobs**: While telling a client what you can do is important, showing them is more crucial. You should invest a lot of time into your Upwork portfolio, aiming for at least three to five portfolio items. Additionally, it's recommended to create a personal portfolio outside of Upwork, such as a static webpage or a simple two-page website with a portfolio and a blog, to showcase your work and generate leads, giving you full control.

• **Be ready for imposter syndrome**: Everyone experiences self-doubt at some point, including full-time freelancers who may worry they aren't good enough or that their success will come crashing down. It's common among freelancers and can be caused by overthinking, such as fearing a two-star review that could harm an Upwork profile. It's important not to compare your beginning (chapter 1) to someone else's advanced stage (chapter 20), but rather to focus on improving yourself by at least one percent every day and being patient.

• **Bad clients exist**: While the Upwork platform is largely positive, bad clients are a reality. The creator shared an experience where a manager closed his contract and left a two-star review without notice, despite delays being caused by an unresponsive internal employee. After this, he became more selective, researching clients and conducting introduction calls before working with them. Though bad experiences can happen, they are rare; he had only one such instance out of over 100 clients and nearly $800,000 earned.

• **Freelancing is not for everyone**: Many people only discuss the benefits of freelancing, such as flexible schedules and higher income. However, achieving these benefits takes a long time and significant sacrifices. Freelancing requires consistent work, and your income is directly tied to your productivity, leading to a constant feeling that you should be doing something productive even when trying to relax. There are no guarantees in freelancing, and you will only get out what you consistently put in. It's hard work and requires a lot from you, but even with the struggles, a single client can change your life by potentially leading to long-term, repeat work.
