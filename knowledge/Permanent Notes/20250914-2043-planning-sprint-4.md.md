# 🚀 Sprint 4 Planning Document (Sept 15–28, 2025)

- **Newsletter Production:** 2 blocks (Wed AM dedicated).
- **Client Work:** 2–3 blocks (Mustapha set + Brit maintenance).

## 📊 Metrics to Track

- Content cadence: streak count in Content DB.
- Newsletter cadence: on-time vs late.
- Leads: # created via funnel.
- Client satisfaction: Mustapha/Brit feedback.
- Personal backlog: cleared yes/no.

---

## 🧭 Guardrails
- “Offer alignment” (free vs. paid funnel) must be clarified before finalizing page copy.  
- WIP limit enforced: In progress = 2 max.  
- Support lane capped at 2 tasks (newsletter + one client obligation).  
- Newsletter anchored to Wednesday AM slot.  

---

## 🌐 Long-Term Product Goals (Q4 2025 Horizon)
1. **Funnel validated and producing repeatable sales.**  
   - Evidence: paying customers, tracked conversions.  

2. **Content engine sustained for 12 consecutive weeks.**  
   - Evidence: Content DB streak, newsletter growth, consistent posts.  

3. **Freelance portfolio live and attracting leads.**  
   - Evidence: Hub + case studies live, inbound inquiries 2/week.  

4. **At least 1 GPT product generating paid demand.**  
   - Evidence: Sales page live, 10 paying customers.  

---

## 📌 Notes
- Use Day 7 midpoint check to enforce funnel live/tested.  
- Newsletter treated as core, not support.  
- Mustapha = commission-only → track ROI but limit time investment.  
- One personal backlog item cleared to reduce friction.
