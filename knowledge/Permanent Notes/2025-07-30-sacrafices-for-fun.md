## Thought  
I ended up not going to Shambhala this year and I am getting a ton of FOMO. Was this the right decision? Am i giving up the prime of my life to pursue this idea of 'freedom' from bullshit bosse while opening myself to shitty clients? 

That is the way I am thinking about itthese days. 

The good thing is taht many of my friends and colleagues really do believe in me. I just need to make contentnand move forward. never stop moving forward. 

my friends who are not as close, but are peopke who are dear to my heart, these people say some things that does bother me slightly

I am really hoping to go to [[Shambhala]] next year with my loved ones and to really 'live it up' 

This year is a year of pain and disspaointments. Its ok. 

There will be next year and future raves. The raves will always be there 
## Context
