**Title**  
Fleeting Note Triage Workflow for Evergreen Note Promotion

**Why it matters**  
Efficiently organizing fleeting notes into actionable, permanent knowledge assets helps drive clarity and speed in decision making, directly supporting faster execution for 2025 business and revenue goals. This structured triage process ensures key information is not lost and is instantly actionable for any team member or automation.

**Desired outcome**  
- > 90% of actionable fleeting notes are reviewed and promoted within 24 hours  
- Reduced information loss from scattered note-taking  
- Consistent, reusable workflow for note promotion across all projects

**Key requirements**  
- Clearly defined triage criteria and template  
- Action-oriented drafting guidelines  
- Seamless tagging for downstream automation  
- Usable in Markdown for interoperability

**Open questions / research**  
- Are additional triage criteria needed for specific teams?  
- What automation options exist for this triage in current note apps?  
- Can feedback loops improve template adoption and output quality?

**Next actions**  
1. Implement template in primary notes app (e.g. Obsidian, Notion)  
2. Pilot triage workflow with recent fleeting notes  
3. Collect feedback from core team after 2 weeks  
4. Share workflow template with wider team via documentation  
5. Review automation opportunities post-pilot
