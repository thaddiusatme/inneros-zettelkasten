# AI Culture and Society Stories Sample

## Hook

Human stories of AI systems failing real people - turning technology promises into personal nightmares. David vs Goliath narratives that expose systemic flaws through individual suffering.

## Outline

### Premise:

AI injustice stories work because they combine:

- Human faces on technological failures
- Emotional stakes (careers, money, reputation)
- David vs Goliath dynamics (individual vs system)
- Credible data backing personal anecdotes

### Key points:

- **Structure**: Emotional hook → Authority backing → Named case studies → Data dump → Expert validation → Practical solution
- **Emotional triggers**: False accusations, destroyed lives, broken systems, no recourse
- **Credibility builders**: Real names, institutions, specific numbers, expert quotes
- **Audience resonance**: Anyone who fears being wrongly judged by algorithmic systems

### CTA:

- Document everything (drafts, process, timestamps)
- Save/share for protection
- "This might save your [career/reputation/future]"

## Notes

**Successful thread elements:**

- Started with dialogue: "Your entire essay was AI-generated"
- Specific victims: Marley Stevens, Maggie Seabolt
- Shocking stats: 92% no error detection, 50% no guidelines
- Expert quotes: Casey Fiesler warning, Lucie Vágnerová anxiety data
- Protective action list with checkmarks

**Story goldmines to watch:**

- AI hiring discrimination
- Medical AI misdiagnosis
- Content moderation false flags
- Surveillance false positives
- Algorithmic bias in criminal justice

**Formula for virality:** Injustice + Real names + Data + Expert voices + Practical value = Viral thread
