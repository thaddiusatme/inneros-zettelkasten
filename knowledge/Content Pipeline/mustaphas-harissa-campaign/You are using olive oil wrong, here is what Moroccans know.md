**Opening Hook:** You’re using olive oil wrong. Here’s what Moroccans know that most people don’t.

**Individual Steps:**

1. In Morocco, olive oil is never just a cooking fat—it’s medicine, tradition, and flavor in one.
    
2. They drizzle it raw over bread for breakfast, believing it strengthens the body more than cooking it.
    
3. High heat destroys its antioxidants, so real Moroccan households only cook lightly with it.
    
4. Freshness is king—families buy from local presses each season, never letting bottles sit for years.
    
5. Olive oil isn’t just for food—it’s used in hair masks, skin care, and even traditional healing.
    
6. Bitter notes in oil? That’s a _good sign_. It means the oil is full of polyphenols.
    
7. Dark glass bottles are preferred—they keep the oil protected from light and spoilage.
    
8. They know which olives make which oil—Picholine Marocaine for peppery, fruity, strong flavors.
