**Thread 1**

- **Opening Hook:** Stop turning Moroccan cuisine into a trend. Here’s how to cook with respect instead of appropriation.*
    
- **Individual Steps:**
    

1. Learn the _why_ behind the spices—cumin, coriander, saffron, and preserved lemon have cultural depth, not just flavor.
2. Use traditional techniques like tagine cooking rather than shortcuts that erase the process.
3. Credit Moroccan chefs, writers, and communities when you share recipes.
4. Buy spices, couscous, and ceramics from Moroccan artisans or small businesses.
5. Avoid renaming dishes into “fusion” concepts that strip them of identity.
6. Ask: am I honoring the culture, or just extracting its aesthetics for likes?

4. Don’t strip recipes down to “healthy hacks” that erase their cultural identity.

- **Individual Steps:**
    

1. Start by studying Moroccan culinary history before recreating dishes.

4. Explore the Moroccan diaspora to see how traditions evolve.
    
5. Support Moroccan food writers and restaurants in your community.
    
6. Always separate appreciation from appropriation: intention + acknowledgment matter.

Would you like me to make one of these threads **more fiery and controversial** (calling out appropriation directly) or keep them **educational and respectful**?
