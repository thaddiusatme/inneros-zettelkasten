**Why it matters** Adopting a TDD mindset for content creation could revolutionize the quality and scalability of outputs, similar to what TDD did for software. This aligns with our push for automation, differentiation, and reliability in our 2025 content initiatives, supporting growth and credibility goals.

**Desired outcome**

- Develop a reusable framework for TDD in content workflows
- Reduce error rate and improve consistency for multi-channel content
- Enable rapid iteration and feedback cycles to match audience needs

**Key requirements**

- Clear process for 'testing' and validating content pre-publication
- Integration with existing automation tools for distribution
- Documentation to enable adoption by all content creators

**Open questions / research**

- What would effective 'tests' look like for written, visual, or audio content?
- What metrics signal a 'passing' piece of content?
- How can toolchains (Claude, Make, Zapier) be adapted for this workflow?

**Next actions**

- Define content TDD process steps and key checkpoints
- Research best practices for TDD outside of software
- Pilot with a single content format (e.g. Threads)
- Gather feedback and iterate on framework
- Document and share pilot findings with team
