## Thought  
It is wild to me that the OpenAI model is competing against humans and winning. it almost seems reasonable today. Almost seems like cheating. 

The other thing I didnt realize was that other models won bronze.

OpenAI model wins gold at math olympiad

OpenAI researchers announced Saturday that their experimental language model achieved gold medal-level performance on the 2025 International Mathematical Olympiad, solving five of six problems under the same time constraints as human competitors. The breakthrough represents a major advance in AI reasoning capabilities, with the model earning 35 out of 42 pointsâ€”enough to secure first place at the world's most prestigious high school mathematics competition[](https://the-decoder.com/openai-claims-a-breakthrough-in-llm-reasoning-on-complex-math-problems/)[](https://simonwillison.net/2025/Jul/19/openai-gold-medal-math-olympiad/).

The achievement stands in stark contrast to recent evaluations showing current AI models struggling with the same problems. According to MathArena.ai, leading models including Gemini 2.5 Pro, Grok-4, and OpenAI's own o3 failed to reach even bronze medal levels on the 2025 IMO, with the best performer managing only 13 points[](https://the-decoder.com/openai-claims-a-breakthrough-in-llm-reasoning-on-complex-math-problems/).
