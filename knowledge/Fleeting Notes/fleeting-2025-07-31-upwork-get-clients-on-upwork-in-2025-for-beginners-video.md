## Thought  
Let me make sure I am understanding.What the video is telling me is that [[Upwork]] is a great place to find my initial clients for very simple work that is bread-and-butter. In this case, working on setting up zones Google profile and upselling them on a monthly retainer that will help bring in more business. Where in this case it's a automation that calls back missed calls.

## Context  

Here's a breakdown of the key elements as described in the sources:

- **Upwork as a Source for Initial Clients and Leads**: The video suggests that most people misunderstand Upwork, viewing it merely as a "gig platform" for one-time jobs, but it should be seen as an **"endless supply of new leads for your business"**. The goal is to use Upwork not just for a single payment but to find new deals that can pay you every month. It is 100% free to create a profile on Upwork. You would search for "jobs" posted by people looking to hire someone to perform specific tasks.
    
- **Initial "Bread-and-Butter" Work (Google My Business Profile Setup)**: The video specifically recommends searching for jobs related to **"Google My Business"**. Many small business owners want a properly set up Google My Business profile to get more five-star reviews and show up at the top of search engines for specific keywords in their area, which leads to more exposure and business. The task of setting up a Google My Business profile is presented as very simple, taking about five minutes to learn, and something many small business owners are willing to pay for because they lack the time to do it themselves. For example, one job posted on Upwork was willing to pay up to $400 for help with a Google My Business profile. The video offers a free step-by-step course, templates, and scripts to show beginners how to set this up, emphasizing that it's beginner-friendly and requires no crazy tech skills or marketing experience.
    
- **Upselling to a Monthly Recurring Retainer**: The critical mistake most people make is stopping at the one-time payment, such as the initial $400 for setting up the Google My Business profile. The strategy aims to[[ avoid being "on the hamster wheel]]" of constantly finding new jobs. Instead, the goal is to **"set up an additional simple service that allows you to create monthly recurring income"**. This means that at the beginning of each month, you're not starting from zero, but have a baseline income. This monthly recurring income can compound over time, growing a "legit solidified real business" and providing "peace of mind". Business owners are described as "happily pay[ing] you that because it's bringing amazing results for their business".
    
- **The Monthly Retainer Service (Automated Missed Call Text-back)**: The additional service recommended for monthly recurring income is **"autois call textback"**. This service leverages a "simple automation software" that takes about five minutes to set up and works on an ongoing monthly basis without additional fulfillment on your end. The value proposition for businesses is that a significant percentage of incoming calls (statistics show 62%) to small businesses go unanswered. When a call is missed, the potential client often moves on to call the next business. The automated missed call text-back system works by sending an automated text message (e.g., "Hey, sorry I missed your call. How can I help you?") when a business misses a phone call. This saves the potential deal and allows the client to text back and forth with the business owner. Businesses are willing to pay for this simple service because it helps them retain clients they would otherwise lose. This service can be charged at $100-$300 per month per client. For example, 10 business owners paying $100 per month would generate $1,000 in monthly recurring income, or $3,000 if charging $300 per month.
    

In summary, the video indeed outlines a strategy of using Upwork for initial Google My Business setup jobs and then upselling clients on a monthly recurring automated missed call text-back service to build a sustainable business with recurring income.
