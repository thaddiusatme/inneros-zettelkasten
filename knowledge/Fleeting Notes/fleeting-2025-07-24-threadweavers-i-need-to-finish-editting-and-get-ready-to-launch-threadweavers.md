## Thought  
Whatever happens, i need to make sure I launch THreadweavers free version. I am collecting emails and I need to hyper focus my marketing towards a certain demographic that needs more soul in their AI. Atleast to build off of different 'personality traits' and quirkiness.

It reminds me of Rim World personality types. 

## Context  
Where did this come from? (Article, conversation, reflection, etc.)

## Next Step  
- [ ] Convert to permanent note?
