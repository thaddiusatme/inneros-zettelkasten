## Thought  
Whatever happens, i need to make sure I launch THreadweavers free version. I am collecting emails and I need to hyper focus my marketing towards a certain demographic that needs more soul in their AI. Atleast to build off of different 'personality traits' and quirkiness.

It reminds me of Rim World personality types. 

## Context
