# One-prompt template survey

Reply with your choices like:

1. Keep: Current Status, P0, Next Action; Drop: P1, P2, TDD, Task Tracker
    I think thats not neccesary for 

2. Acceptance Criteria bullets
We should just include this

1. List styles
- Use checkboxes [ ] for actionable items (Yes/No)
- Use dashes bullets for everything else (Yes/No)

1. Placeholder style
use {VARIABLe} instead

1. Single prompt contents (we’ll still show only ONE prompt) Choose what you want to capture in that single prompt besides Feature/Branch:
None of these

1. If #5 includes multiple items, format preference for the one prompt Pick one:
N/A

1. Frontmatter
- Keep type: fleeting? yes
- Keep tags: [prompt, chatgpt, inbox]? yes
- Keep status: inbox and visibility: private?yes

1. Filename
- Keep pattern prompt-YYYYMMDD-HHmm-.md? (Yes/No)
  yes, but confirm we are not .md.md

1. Hidden vs removed sections

2. Default “Current Status” bullets
NA

Once you reply, I’ll update 

knowledge/Templates/chatgpt-prompt.md to:
- Keep only your chosen sections
- Parse the single prompt into those fields (if selected)
- Preserve fleeting-style rename/move to Inbox/
- Ensure zero secondary prompts
