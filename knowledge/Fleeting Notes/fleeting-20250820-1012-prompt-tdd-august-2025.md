## Thought  
This prompt is used at the end of a TDD Iteration
# The Prompt
Help me craft the next prompt for a new chat with fresh context. Keep a similar structure as below:

## The Prompt
Let's create a new branch for the next feature/task in our execution plan. We want to follow TDD methodology with red-green-refactor phases, then git commit and document lessons learned. This equals one iteration.

## Updated Execution Plan
[BRIEF SUMMARY OF CURRENT PROJECT STATE AND PRIORITIES]

## Current Status
- **In progress**: [CURRENT TASK/FEATURE BEING WORKED ON]
- **Recently completed**: [LAST COMPLETED MILESTONE]

## Priority Tasks
### P0 — Critical Path
- [HIGHEST PRIORITY ITEMS THAT UNBLOCK OTHER WORK]

### P1 — Core Features  
- [IMPORTANT FEATURES FOR CURRENT MILESTONE]

### P2 — Polish & Optimization
- [NICE-TO-HAVE IMPROVEMENTS]

## Task Tracker
- **[In progress]** [current-task-identifier]
- [Pending] [next-task-identifier]
- [Pending] [subsequent-task-identifier]

## Next Action (suggested)
[SPECIFIC NEXT STEP WITH CLEAR ACCEPTANCE CRITERIA]

Would you like me to implement [NEXT_TASK] now in small, reviewable commits?
# Context  
Where did this come from? (Article, conversation, reflection, etc.)


# Next Step  
- [ ] Convert to permanent note?
