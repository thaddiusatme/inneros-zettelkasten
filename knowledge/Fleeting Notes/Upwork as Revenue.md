- **Type**: Fleeting
- **Context**: Considering additional income streams while scaling AI Humble Servant
- **Idea**: Treat Upwork as a low-risk sandbox to rapidly validate micro-offers (e.g., 5-hour GPT prompt audits, quick automations)
- **Why it matters**:
    1. Immediate cash flow without heavy marketing
    2. Real client feedback sharpens service positioning
    3. Portfolio proof points for higher-ticket consulting
- **Next action**: Draft two niche gig descriptions today and post by Friday
