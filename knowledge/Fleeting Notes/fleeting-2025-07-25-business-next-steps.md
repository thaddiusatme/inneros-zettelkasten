# Thought
I'm at a pivot point in my business. Iâ€™ve shipped enough to know whatâ€™s resonating, and now itâ€™s time to refocus on what drives revenue and retention. I need to align my energy with the offers and channels that actually convert.

# Next Steps
- Audit current offers and map each one to a revenue goal or segment
- Choose 1â€“2 offers to double down on for Q3
- Revisit ThreadWeavers and AI Humble Servant positioning to reduce overlap
- Send a newsletter update on where things are heading
- Schedule deep work sprint to finalize the GPT workshop materials
- Identify 3 daily leverage activities (e.g., Reels, DMs, carousel repurposing)

# Reflection Prompt
What will matter most 30 days from nowâ€”volume, depth, or clarity?
