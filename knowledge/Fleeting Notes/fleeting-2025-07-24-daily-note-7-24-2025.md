## Thought  
Today my energy level is a bit low. I find myself melancholic since I was reminded heavily about my bad financial decisions in my life. I know i have some cushion to sruvive, but I took a risk on my retirement to survive as much as I have. 

Today I hope to get lot of things done on my list.

## Context  
Where did this come from? (Article, conversation, reflection, etc.)

## Next Step
