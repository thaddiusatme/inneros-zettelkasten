## Thought  
give it to a guy named PsyHo to defeat AI in a programming contest. what a triumph that humans can still win in some of the current games that we can compete in. its a very inclusive idea until the apocalypse takes us

# Przemysław Dębiak's Coding Career

Przemysław Dębiak, the Polish programmer who triumphed over OpenAI's model at the AtCoder World Tour Finals, has an impressive competitive programming background. He's a four-time champion of the TopCoder Open Marathon Match[](https://hyper.ai/en/headlines/c341f857585e8e25d09d7c9d2667bcf2) and previously worked for OpenAI itself, where he was one of the pioneering engineers behind OpenAI Five—the AI system that defeated professional Dota 2 players in 2019[](https://www.thehansindia.com/technology/tech-news/human-coder-triumphs-over-openai-in-10-hour-atcoder-showdown-989395). The 41-year-old from Gdynia, Poland[](https://news.ssbcrack.com/human-programmer-defeats-openai-ai-model-in-atcoder-world-tour-finals-2025/) is well-respected in coding circles, competing under the name "Psyho."

The contest where Dębiak defeated AI showcased his unique approach to problem-solving. While OpenAI's model excelled at optimization, competition administrator Yoichi Iwata noted that Dębiak "arrived at a completely different solution"[](https://www.businessinsider.com/programmer-beat-openai-atcoder-coding-competition-sam-altman-psyho-2025-7) that demonstrated superior creativity. Fellow coder Stanisław Eysmont emphasized that Dębiak "succeeded without pre-built tools, without reference materials, and without any guidance"[](https://www.thehansindia.com/technology/tech-news/human-coder-triumphs-over-openai-in-10-hour-atcoder-showdown-989395), highlighting the human ingenuity that gave him the edge over artificial intelligence in this landmark competition.

'Give it to the person who helped develop the AI that defeat pro DOTA 2 players in 2019 to beat AI at its own game. Also, showcasing his problem-solving approach. Displaying his creativity. Because of the ingenuity, it has never been 'seen' thus wasnt abel to be trained on, now that the gig is up, its now time for human ingenuinity to continue to outflank AI'
