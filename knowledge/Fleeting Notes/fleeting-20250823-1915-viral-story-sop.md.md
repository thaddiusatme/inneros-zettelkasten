## Thought  
### Viral Story SOP

Use this every time a post hits above average reach or replies.
1. Save post URL and export comments    
2. Break down structure: pattern interrupt, tension, vivid detail, turn, takeaway, CTA
3. Mine 5 comments for questions or objections and turn them into new hooks
4. Draft 5 remixes: shorten, lengthen, change opening frame, swap detail, flip moral
5. Schedule 2 to 3 remixes over the next 10 days
6. Log results in Notion and keep the best performing variant as a template

## Context  
we want to make the magic happen again, so sop the process and analyze
