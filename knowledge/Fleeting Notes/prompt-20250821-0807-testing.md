## The prompt
Let's create a new branch for the next feature: testing.
We want to perform TDD with red, green, refactor phases, followed by git commit and lessons learned documentation. This equals one iteration.

Updated Execution Plan (focused P0/P1): testing
I'm following the guidance in testing (critical path: testing).

Current Status
- Completed: testing
- In progress: testing in testing
- Lessons from last iteration: tesintg

### P0 — Critical/Unblocker ([PRIORITY_LABEL])
- [MAIN_P0_TASK]: [SPECIFIC_IMPLEMENTATION_DETAIL_1] [SPECIFIC_IMPLEMENTATION_DETAIL_2] [SPECIFIC_IMPLEMENTATION_DETAIL_3]
- [SECONDARY_P0_TASK] (if applicable): [IMPLEMENTATION_DETAILS]
- Acceptance Criteria:
  - [MEASURABLE_OUTCOME_1]
  - [MEASURABLE_OUTCOME_2]

### P1 — [NEXT_PRIORITY_THEME] ([PRIORITY_LABEL])
- [P1_TASK_1]: [IMPLEMENTATION_APPROACH] [MIGRATION_STRATEGY]
- [P1_TASK_2]: [TECHNICAL_DETAILS]
- [P1_TASK_3]: [IMPLEMENTATION_NOTES]
- Acceptance Criteria:
  - [MEASURABLE_OUTCOME_1]
  - [MEASURABLE_OUTCOME_2]

### P2 — [FUTURE_IMPROVEMENTS_THEME] ([PRIORITY_LABEL])
- [P2_TASK_1]: [BRIEF_DESCRIPTION]
- [P2_TASK_2]: [BRIEF_DESCRIPTION]
- [P2_TASK_3]: [BRIEF_DESCRIPTION]

## Task Tracker

- [ ] Pending — [FUTURE_TASK_ID_4]

## TDD Cycle Plan
- Red Phase: [DESCRIBE_FAILING_TEST_TO_WRITE]
- Green Phase: [DESCRIBE_MINIMAL_IMPLEMENTATION]
- Refactor Phase: [DESCRIBE_CLEANUP_OPPORTUNITIES]

## Next Action (for this session)
[SPECIFIC_ACTIONABLE_TASK_WITH_FILE_REFERENCES]

> Would you like me to implement [SPECIFIC_CHANGE] now in small, reviewable commits?
