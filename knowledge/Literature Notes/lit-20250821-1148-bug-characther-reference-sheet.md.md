# Prompt
This is an audience avatar you gave me. I want to expand out the detailed scenario sections on the avatars. 

My goal is to turn them into 'illustrations' using a chracter reference sheet I have. 

The current goal is to expand their scenarios. Following that in a follow up chat will be to create a illustration and provide that instructions to a midourney/chatgpt image prompt intake
