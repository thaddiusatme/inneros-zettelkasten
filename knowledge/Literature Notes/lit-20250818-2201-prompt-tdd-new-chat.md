help me craft the next prompt for the next/new chat with fresh context. Keep a similar structure as the below ## The prompt
Let's create a new branch for the next feature: [FEATURE_NAME]. We want to perform TDD framework with red, green, refactor phases, followed by git commit and lessons learned documentation. This equals one iteration. Updated Execution Plan (focused P0/P1) [BRIEF_CONTEXT_OF_CURRENT_PRIORITIES] I'm following the guidance in [RELEVANT_RULES/STANDARDS] (critical path: [CURRENT_BLOCKER/PRIORITY]). Current Status Completed: [PREVIOUS_TASK_COMPLETED] In progress: [CURRENT_TASK_DESCRIPTION] in [FILE_PATH_WITH_FUNCTION] Lessons from last iteration: [KEY_LEARNINGS_FROM_PREVIOUS_CYCLE] P0 — Critical/Unblocker ([PRIORITY_LABEL]) [MAIN_P0_TASK]: [SPECIFIC_IMPLEMENTATION_DETAIL_1] [SPECIFIC_IMPLEMENTATION_DETAIL_2] [SPECIFIC_IMPLEMENTATION_DETAIL_3] [SECONDARY_P0_TASK] (if applicable): [IMPLEMENTATION_DETAILS] Acceptance Criteria: [MEASURABLE_OUTCOME_1] [MEASURABLE_OUTCOME_2] P1 — [NEXT_PRIORITY_THEME] ([PRIORITY_LABEL]) [P1_TASK_1]: [IMPLEMENTATION_APPROACH] [MIGRATION_STRATEGY] (if applicable) [P1_TASK_2]: [TECHNICAL_DETAILS] [P1_TASK_3]: [IMPLEMENTATION_NOTES] Acceptance Criteria: [MEASURABLE_OUTCOME_1] [MEASURABLE_OUTCOME_2] P2 — [FUTURE_IMPROVEMENTS_THEME] ([PRIORITY_LABEL]) [P2_TASK_1]: [BRIEF_DESCRIPTION] [P2_TASK_2]: [BRIEF_DESCRIPTION] [P2_TASK_3]: [BRIEF_DESCRIPTION] Task Tracker [In progress] [CURRENT_TASK_ID] [Pending] [NEXT_TASK_ID] [Pending] [FUTURE_TASK_ID_1] [Pending] [FUTURE_TASK_ID_2] [Pending] [FUTURE_TASK_ID_3] [Pending] [FUTURE_TASK_ID_4] TDD Cycle Plan Red Phase: [DESCRIBE_FAILING_TEST_TO_WRITE] Green Phase: [DESCRIBE_MINIMAL_IMPLEMENTATION] Refactor Phase: [DESCRIBE_CLEANUP_OPPORTUNITIES] Next Action (for this session) [SPECIFIC_ACTIONABLE_TASK_WITH_FILE_REFERENCES] Would you like me to implement [SPECIFIC_CHANGE] now in small, reviewable commits?
