Here’s how I’d handle this fleeting note and move it toward a permanent one:

# 📝 Permanent Note Draft

## Title

**Personal Stories as Business Development Tools**

## Core Idea

Business is inherently personal. Development and sales are not driven only by rational analysis, but by emotional resonance. Personal stories build intimacy and trust, creating the human connections that enable business growth.

## Key Points

- **Buying is emotional**: When prices rise, risk perception increases, and buyers lean more on trust and stories than pure logic.
- **Story hesitation**: Many hesitate to share personal stories, but those are what foster real connection.
- **Narrative intimacy**: Stories allow others to step into your shoes; people want to see heroes overcoming adversity.

## Supporting Evidence to Gather

[[ Study link between price risk and trust in decision-making]]
- [ ]  [[Media reference on “hammer point” (memorable anchoring stories in communication).]]

## Personal Anecdote

- Told as a child I was “bad at math.”
- Internalized a limiting belief: “not smart enough.”
- Late-adult ADHD diagnosis revealed lack of tools, not lack of intelligence.
- Had to relearn from the ground up, eventually completed calculus series and entered engineering school.
- Lesson: struggles can be reframed as proof of resilience and growth.
- Today, the memory reaffirms intelligence and adaptability.
- Broader insight: people can change, and telling these stories inspires others.

## Links to Broader Themes

- Hero’s journey framing in marketing and sales.
- Vulnerability as a tool for leadership and trust.
- Intimacy at scale: stories transform “transactions” into “relationships.”

## Next Steps

- [x] Find empirical study on **price, risk, and emotional decision-making**.
- [x] Find a “hammer point” style media reference (possibly from Chip & Dan Heath’s _Made to Stick_).
- [ ] Draft Threads/Twitter post pulling 1 insight + anecdote.
- [ ] Draft longer essay weaving anecdote + research into a framework for business storytelling.

Would you like me to:

1. **Zettelkasten-link this** to your existing notes on **business intimacy, sales psychology, and ADHD reframing**, or
2. Keep it standalone as a general “storytelling in business” permanent note?
