**Thread 3**

- **Opening Hook:** Ever wonder why your jarred peppers taste so different from fresh ones? Here’s the science behind it.
    
- **Individual Steps:**
    
    1. Acidity from vinegar alters the pepper’s cell structure.
        
    2. Heat during pickling breaks down natural sugars.
        
    3. Salt creates osmotic pressure, drawing out water and intensifying flavor.
        
    4. Spices in the brine infuse over weeks, layering complexity.
