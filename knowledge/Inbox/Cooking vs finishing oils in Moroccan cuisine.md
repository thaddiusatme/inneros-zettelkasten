**Thread 1**

- **Opening Hook:** Most people ruin Moroccan dishes without realizing it. The secret? Knowing when to cook with oil and when to finish with it.*
    
- **Individual Steps:**
    

1. Cooking oils (like sunflower oil) are heat-stable and used for frying or base cooking.
    
2. Moroccan cooks avoid olive oil for deep frying—it smokes and gets bitter.
    
3. Finishing oils (like extra virgin olive oil or argan oil) are drizzled at the end.
    
4. Olive oil finishing enhances couscous, tagines, and salads with richness.
    
5. Argan oil is rare but prized for its nutty flavor—only added after cooking.
    
6. Ghee (smen) can be both: cooked into tagines or added sparingly at the end.
    
7. The wrong oil at the wrong time changes flavor, aroma, and even digestion.

**Thread 2**

- **Opening Hook:** Why does your Moroccan tagine never taste like it does in Marrakesh? You’re probably using the wrong oil at the wrong time.*
    
- **Individual Steps:**
    

1. Start cooking with neutral oils like sunflower or light olive oil.
    
2. Heavy cooking with extra virgin olive oil? That’s a rookie mistake.
    
3. True depth of flavor comes from adding finishing oils at the table.
    
4. Drizzle cold-pressed argan oil over roasted vegetables for luxury.
    
5. Olive oil added raw preserves its fruity, peppery kick.
    
6. Some families keep separate bottles: “for fire” and “for table.”
    
7. Mastering this difference is the line between “good” and “authentic.”

**Thread 3**

- **Opening Hook:** In Moroccan kitchens, oil is more than cooking fat—it’s a storytelling ingredient. Here’s how it changes depending on when you use it.*
    
- **Individual Steps:**
    

1. Cooking oils = functional. Think sunflower, rapeseed, or blended oils.
    
2. Finishing oils = emotional. Extra virgin olive oil links meals to tradition.
    
3. Argan oil is ceremonial—often saved for guests or special occasions.
    
4. Street food vendors cook with cheap oils, but always finish with olive.
    
5. Rural homes press their own olive oil, treating it like gold.
    
6. Adding oil after cooking preserves nutrients and antioxidants.
    
7. Oil timing signals whether you’re feeding family, friends, or honoring tradition.

**Thread 4**

- **Opening Hook:** A Moroccan grandmother will never forgive you if you fry with her argan oil. Here’s why oil timing is sacred in Moroccan cuisine.*
    
- **Individual Steps:**
    

1. Frying = sunflower or light olive oil, never premium oils.
    
2. Slow cooking = mix of neutral oil plus a little regular olive oil.
    
3. Tagines are finished with a splash of raw olive oil before serving.
    
4. Couscous gets olive oil folded in _after_ steaming, not before.
    
5. Argan oil is drizzled raw over amlou, salads, or roasted veggies.
    
6. Using finishing oils for cooking wastes flavor and nutrition.
    
7. Cooking oils survive the fire—finishing oils survive the tradition.

**Thread 5**

- **Opening Hook:** One simple rule separates tourists from Moroccan home cooks: never confuse cooking oils with finishing oils.*
    
- **Individual Steps:**
    

1. Use neutral oils to start your dish—heat stability matters.
    
2. Add smen (fermented butter) during cooking for depth.
    
3. Finish couscous with olive oil for shine and aroma.
    
4. Drizzle argan oil over fish tagine for a nutty kick.
    
5. Never fry in extra virgin olive oil—it burns before it cooks.
    
6. Moroccan chefs treat finishing oils like perfumes, not frying pans.
    
7. Cooking oils feed the dish, finishing oils elevate the soul.
