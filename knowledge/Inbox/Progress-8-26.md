## ✅ Progress so far (by Aug 26 EOD)

**Funnel:**
- Content calendar groundwork happening (threads, IG, FB) → baseline distribution in motion.
- Newsletter research + outline done (supports content engine).
- Mustapha calendar v0 complete (client proof, portfolio material).
- Sprint 2 doc clarified (goals/guardrails are sharper).
    

**Portfolio:**
- You’ve identified potential case study candidates (Pharmacy Scraper, Clarity Compass IT, ThreadWeavers Starter Kit, Audience Builder GPT, Mustapha content sprint).
- Haven’t yet picked the final 3 or gathered proof assets → was due Tue (slipping).

## ⚠️ At risk / slipping
- **Case studies:** Deadline to _pick 3_ was Tue → not locked yet. Need to pull metrics + visuals by Wed (tomorrow) or the whole chain backs up.
- **Work With Me page:** No draft live yet, deadline Fri.
- **Warm outreach:** Not started, due Fri.
- **Funnel live path (bio link → checkout → confirmation):** Not yet shipped.

## 📌 Next 48 hrs (Wed–Thu) — critical increments

1. **Pick 3 projects** for case studies and lock them in Notion DB (late).
2. **Pull one metric, one visual, permission for each** (due Wed).
3. **Draft 3 case studies** with template (due Thu).
4. **Newsletter finalization** (edits + visuals) to hit Thu publish.
5. **Run Perplexity + Claude pass** on Mustapha’s calendar (client deliverable).

## 🚦 Status vs Sprint Goals

- **ThreadWeavers funnel validated?** Partial — content/distribution prep happening, but checkout/confirmation flow not live yet.
- **Audience Builder GPT demand?** Out of sprint scope, but relevant as proof for portfolio.
- **Content engine cadence?** On track — newsletter + calendars advancing.
- **Client work protected?** Mostly on track, but SLA board needs to be visible.
- **Freelance portfolio live?** At risk — portfolio track (case studies + Work With Me page + outreach) is behind.
