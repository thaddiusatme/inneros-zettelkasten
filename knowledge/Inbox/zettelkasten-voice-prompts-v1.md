# üé§ Zettelkasten Voice Note Prompts v1.0

**For Samsung S23 Knowledge Capture - Zettelkasten Optimized**

## üß† **The Zettelkasten 3-A Formula** (30 seconds max)
1. **Atomic** (10s): What's the single, specific idea here?
2. **Associate** (10s): How does this connect to existing concepts in my system?
3. **Advance** (10s): How does this develop or challenge my current thinking?

### **üíé Atomic Idea Extraction**
*"The core idea here is [single concept]. This is distinct from but related to [existing concept in my system]. This could become a permanent note about [broader principle]."*

### **üîó Connection Discovery**  
*"This connects to my notes on [concept A] and [concept B] because [relationship]. The new insight is [synthesis]. This suggests a pattern about [emerging theme]."*

### **üå± Concept Development**
*"This builds on my thinking about [existing concept] by adding [new dimension]. My original understanding was [previous view], but this shows [evolution]. Next: develop this into [permanent note idea]."*

### **‚ö° Contradiction/Tension**
*"This contradicts what I wrote about [topic] in [note]. The tension is between [view A] and [view B]. This suggests I need to refine my model of [concept]."*

### **üéØ Synthesis Opportunity**
*"This example of [concept] plus my note on [related concept] suggests a broader principle: [synthesis]. This could be a new permanent note connecting [theme/pattern]."*

## üèóÔ∏è **By Zettelkasten Note Type**

### **üìù Fleeting ‚Üí Permanent Pathway**
*"Fleeting idea: [raw insight]. The atomic concept is [core idea]. This could develop into a permanent note about [principle/pattern] by connecting it to [existing notes]. Key question to explore: [research direction]."*

### **üìö Literature Note Focus**
*"From [source]: the author's main claim is [argument]. My take: [personal interpretation]. This challenges/supports my thinking on [existing concept]. Connection to [my note]: [relationship]."*

### **üé® Concept Map Building**
*"This is an example of [higher-order concept]. Other examples in my system: [note A], [note B]. The pattern I'm seeing: [emerging principle]. This maps to my understanding of [broader framework]."*

### **üîç Research Question Generation**
*"This raises the question: [specific question]. Related to my ongoing thinking about [concept area]. This question connects to [existing notes] and could lead to research on [direction]."*

## üé® **Zettelkasten Capture Patterns**

### **Pattern 1: Concept Refinement** (25-30 seconds)
*"I'm looking at [example/evidence]. The core concept is [idea]. This refines my understanding of [existing concept] by showing [new dimension]. In my note on [topic], I said [previous understanding], but this adds [nuance]. This could evolve into a permanent note about [refined concept]."*

### **Pattern 2: Connection Discovery** (20-25 seconds)  
*"This shows [concept A] connecting to [concept B] through [relationship]. I hadn't seen this link before. This bridges my notes on [topic 1] and [topic 2]. The meta-principle might be [higher-order insight]. Worth exploring as [research direction]."*

### **Pattern 3: Example Collection** (15-20 seconds)
*"This is another example of [concept from my system]. Previous examples: [note A], [note B]. The pattern across all these: [emerging principle]. This strengthens my theory about [broader concept]."*

### **Pattern 4: Question Generation** (20-25 seconds)
*"This raises the question: [specific question]. This connects to my ongoing research on [topic area]. Related questions from [existing note]: [related questions]. This could be a research thread worth developing."*

## üß© **Optimizing for Zettelkasten Workflow**

### **Immediate Processing (What AI Should Extract)**
- **Atomic concept identification**
- **Connection suggestions to existing notes**  
- **Development pathway recommendations**
- **Research question generation**

### **Weekly Review Integration**
- **Promotion candidates** (fleeting ‚Üí permanent)
- **Connection opportunities** (notes that should link)
- **Concept clusters** (emerging themes)
- **Development priorities** (concepts needing work)

### **Long-term System Building**
- **Concept evolution tracking** (how ideas develop)
- **Network strength analysis** (well-connected vs isolated ideas)
- **Research thread identification** (questions worth pursuing)
- **Knowledge gap detection** (areas needing development)

## üìã **Zettelkasten Voice Note Examples**

### **Example 1: Concept Development** (28 seconds)
*"I'm reading about compound interest in learning. The atomic idea is that small, consistent knowledge connections create exponential understanding over time. This builds on my note about knowledge compounding but adds the temporal dimension - it's not just about connections, but about the timing and consistency of making them. This challenges my earlier thinking that focused only on connection quality. This could become a permanent note about temporal aspects of knowledge building."*

### **Example 2: Connection Discovery** (24 seconds)
*"This article about AI workflow automation connects to my note on knowledge management systems through the principle of progressive enhancement. Both involve starting simple and gradually adding AI assistance. This suggests a broader pattern: successful human-AI integration follows progressive enhancement rather than replacement models. This links my technology notes to my learning theory notes in a new way."*

### **Example 3: Research Question** (22 seconds)
*"This data about user behavior raises the question: do people learn better with immediate feedback or delayed reflection? This connects to my notes on spaced repetition and flow states. The tension between immediate reinforcement and reflective processing could be a key research thread. This deserves investigation across multiple domains."*

## üéØ **Quick Zettelkasten Cheat Sheet**

### **Before Recording, Ask:**
- What's the ONE idea here?
- What does this connect to in my system?
- How does this change my thinking?
- What question does this raise?

### **While Recording, Include:**
- Specific note titles you're connecting to
- Your personal interpretation, not just the source
- The type of relationship (supports, challenges, extends)
- What development this idea needs

### **After Recording, AI Should Help:**
- Identify the atomic concept
- Suggest specific note connections
- Recommend development pathway
- Generate research questions

**Remember: In Zettelkasten, we're not just capturing information - we're building a thinking partner that helps us develop and connect ideas over time.**
