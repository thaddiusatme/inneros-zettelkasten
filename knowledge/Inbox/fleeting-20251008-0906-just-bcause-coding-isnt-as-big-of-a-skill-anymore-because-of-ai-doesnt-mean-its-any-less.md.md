## Thought  
Write the idea that just popped into your head.
I think a lot about the programmers who think coding isnt as lucrative. i believe system designs will be important, but just because like in traditional IT, any idiot can build their pwon PC, it doesnt mean some of the deeper skills are not as important

## Context  
Where did this come from? (Article, conversation, reflection, etc.)

## Next Step  
- [ ] Convert to permanent note?
