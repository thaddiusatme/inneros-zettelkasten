## Thought  
We need to take note of what our current state of the project is. I really just want to give away ThreadWeavers Premium for free, but people will not understand its value, thus impacting the metrics on this product. Lets make it one route, where I only sell Threadweavers Premium. 



## Context  
## Internal Memo (Draft)

**Subject:** ThreadWeavers Free Access — Strategic Positioning

We are not “giving away” premium content randomly. This is **Founders Launch Access**:

- **Why free?** Strategic seeding. Build community, gather testimonials, test automations.
- **What’s included?** The full \$297 ThreadWeavers kit (course + GPTs).
- **Framing:** “Free during Founders Launch — for a limited time.”
- **End condition:** Will close on [insert date] OR after [X signups]. After that, offer transitions to paid tiers.
- **Tags & automations:**
    
    - Free opt-in → `Free_ThreadWeavers`
    - Tripwire buyer → `TW_Tripwire_Buyer`
    - Newsletter only → `Newsletter_Subscriber`
    - Upsell waitlist → `TW_Workshop_Waitlist`
    - Consult call → `TW_Consult_Call`
- **Next phase:** Launch paid tiers with upsells (workshop, consult calls).

This resolves confusion by positioning free access as **intentional, time-limited, and valuable**.

## Next Step  
- [ ] Convert to permanent note?
