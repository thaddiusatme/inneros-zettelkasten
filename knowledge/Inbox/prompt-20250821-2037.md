## The prompt
Great, now I want you to help me create scenarios where knowing things about an audience avatar allows me to target things that Sarah-Bot desires and loves.

I am thinking an 4X4 square that is 4:5. I want there to be 8 symbols that relate to Sarah-bots specific audience avatar factors.

Does that make sense? Ask me clarifying questions to confirm.
