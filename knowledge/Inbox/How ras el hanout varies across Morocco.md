Perfect topic. Let’s turn “ras el hanout” into viral, curiosity-driven Facebook threads that make people want to read and share. Here are **five different thread-style posts** about how ras el hanout varies across Morocco:

---

**Thread 1**

- **Opening Hook:** Ras el hanout isn’t one recipe. It’s a secret signature. Each Moroccan region rewrites the spice blend in its own way.
    
- **Individual Steps:**
    
    1. In Marrakech, ras el hanout leans floral with dried rosebuds and lavender.
        
    2. Fez favors a warm, complex mix with cardamom and cinnamon at its core.
        
    3. Coastal towns like Essaouira add citrus peel for brightness.
        
    4. In the Atlas Mountains, blends are heavier with earthy cumin and fenugreek.
        
    5. Some merchants guard versions with more than 30 spices.
        
    6. The name literally means “head of the shop” — the very best the spice seller offers.
        
    7. No two spice merchants in Morocco sell the exact same blend.

**Thread 2**

- **Opening Hook:** Think ras el hanout is just “Moroccan curry powder”? That’s a myth. Here’s how it changes from city to city.
    
- **Individual Steps:**
    
    1. Casablanca: streamlined and accessible, often 10–12 spices.
        
    2. Fez: adds rare aromatics like orris root, making it almost perfumed.
        
    3. Tangier: heavy on ginger and black pepper for a sharper kick.
        
    4. Marrakech: saffron-rich, reflecting the city’s spice trade wealth.
        
    5. Desert towns: sometimes mix in dried herbs from the Sahara, like wild thyme.
        
    6. Every version tells the story of trade routes and local tastes.
