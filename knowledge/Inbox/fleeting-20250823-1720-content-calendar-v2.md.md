## Thought  
# AI Humble Servant — Content Calendar MVP

A one‑page, easy‑to‑run content system you can ship today.

## 1) Goals and guardrails

- Primary goal: build trust, grow list, drive $27 Starter Kit trials.
    
- Constraints: no emojis, calm urgency tone, minimalist style.
    
- 80/20 rule: focus on 3 repeatable formats that you can sustain.
    

## 2) Core content pillars

1. **Teach** — tutorials, SOPs, walkthroughs, myth‑busting.
    
2. **Show** — case studies, before and after, behind the scenes.
    
3. **Sell softly** — value first, then CTA to Starter Kit, newsletter, or clarity call.
    

## 3) 80/20 format stack (pick 3)

- **B‑roll + voiceover** — short, crisp tips or 1 insight.
    
- **Talking‑head punch‑in** — face camera, one strong point, on‑screen text.
    
- **Screen demo + reaction** — webcam corner, screen on top, react to a workflow.
    
- **Carousel (slides)** — frameworks, checklists, mini‑guides.
    
- **Threads text** — 1 idea, 3‑7 lines, clear takeaway.
    

## 4) Platform cheat sheet

|Platform|Daily target|High‑leverage formats|Cross‑post notes|
|---|--:|---|---|
|Instagram|1 post|Reels: B‑roll + VO, talking‑head, screen demo. Carousels as alternates.|Reels can cross‑post to Facebook. Carousel becomes album on FB.|
|Facebook|1 post|Reels, link posts to longform, authority image + copy.|Reuse IG Reel. Add 1‑2 short paragraphs.|
|Threads|1 post|Text threads, image + caption, quick screen snippet.|Turn each day’s hook into a concise thread.|

## 4a) Channel roles and routing rules

**Channel roles**

- **Threads**: primary daily post. Short text threads, quick visuals. Seed each day's hook here first.
    
- **Facebook Page**: authority hub and portfolio. Cross-post most Threads content that is educational or case-study oriented. Add 1 to 2 paragraphs for context.
    
- **Facebook Personal Profile**: personal-first. Share life lessons, behind-the-scenes, and values. Limit business mentions to 40 to 60 percent of your personal posts in any 30-day window. Avoid hard pitches.
    
- **Facebook Group** (if used): community-first. Questions, polls, worksheets. No links on every post. Focus on discussion.
    
- **Instagram**: discovery and brand. Reels and carousels built from the same hook.
    

**Facebook Page vs Personal Profile addendum**

|Channel|Role|Frequency|Cross-post from Threads|Sales cap|
|---|---|--:|---|---|
|FB Page|Authority and portfolio|1 per day|Yes, most Threads posts|Soft CTA allowed 3 to 4 times per week|
|FB Personal|Personal first|Max 3 posts per week|Only posts reframed as personal stories or lessons|Keep business mentions at 40 to 60 percent of total posts. Max 1 direct link per week.|

**Routing decision in 5 steps**

1. Draft the hook on Threads.
    
2. Ask: is this a tutorial or a sales-forward post? If yes, do not post to Personal Profile. Route to FB Page, IG, and Group.
    
3. If it is a personal story, principle, or behind-the-scenes, it can go to Personal Profile. Reframe with a human lesson.
    
4. If posting to Personal Profile, use a soft CTA or no CTA. If needed, place the link in the first comment rather than the body.
    
5. Track your Personal Profile ratio: for every 10 personal posts, allow 4 to 6 to mention business. Only 1 of those should include a direct link.
    

**Soft-sell copy blocks**

- Story lens: "A small win from this week: [human moment]. It reminded me why I care about [value]. If you are working through something similar, I put the notes in my newsletter."
    
- Lesson lens: "What surprised me about [situation] was [insight]. If you want the checklist I used, it is in the Starter Kit."
    
- Community lens: "If you have navigated [challenge], share your story below. I am collecting patterns for a write-up."
    

**40 to 60 percent tracker template**  
Add these three columns to your weekly table for Personal Profile posts:

- Mentions business: Yes or No
    
- CTA strength: None, Soft, Link
    
- Running ratio this month: [x of y]
    

## 5) Weekly cadence pattern (repeat every week)

Use the same hook across platforms, adapt the format.

|Day|Pillar|IG format|FB format|Threads format|CTA|
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
|Mon|Teach|Reel: B‑roll + VO tip|Reel + 2‑paragraph caption|5‑line tip thread|Newsletter|
|Tue|Show|Carousel: mini SOP|Album + short copy|3‑step thread|Starter Kit|
|Wed|Teach|Reel: screen demo + reaction|Reel + summary|Thread with 1 screenshot|Starter Kit|
|Thu|Show|Talking‑head: case study|Reel + link to longform|7‑line case thread|Clarity call|
|Fri|Teach|Carousel: checklist|Album + explanation|Checklist thread|Starter Kit|
|Sat|Show|BTS Reel: process|Reel + human story|Personal note thread|Newsletter|
|Sun|Sell softly|Talking‑head: recap and offer|Reel + testimonial pull|Offer thread|Starter Kit|

- Reuse the same hook across platforms. Adapt captions to the platform.
- Keep a simple Notion or sheet with this table. Fill hook and topic first, formats second.
- Measure signals weekly: saves, replies, clicks, and call bookings.
