# 80/20 analysis of your Kanban board

## The vital 20 percent to ship next

These five items will produce ~80 percent of the impact on revenue, lead gen, and momentum.

1. Mustapha 30-day social campaign
    

- Why: Paid client work and a public case study for your freelance portfolio. Direct path to cash and referrals.
    
- Definition of Done: 30-day content plan, 12 finished posts, 3 creative templates, offer and UTM tracking, kickoff scheduled and delivered.
    
- First steps: Lock core message and 3 pillars, draft week 1 posts and visual template, create tracking sheet, confirm deliverables and dates with Mustapha.
    

2. Audience Builder GPT sales push
    

- Why: Aligns with your $27 tripwire and $97 and $197 ascension path. Fastest lever for small wins at scale.
    
- Bundle these cards: Promote current version of ThreadWeavers community for FREE, Trip Wire Marketing Campaign, Sales page updates and review snippets.
    
- Definition of Done: Final sales page with social proof image block, 5-email mini sequence, 7 social posts, updated link in bio, checkout test.
    
- First steps: Drop in the review images, write the 5-email sequence, schedule posts to Threads and IG, set a 48-hour micro-launch window.
    

3. Viral post analysis and replication
    

- Why: You already have proof of resonance. Systematizing this increases top-of-funnel and warms the list for the tripwire.
    
- Definition of Done: Brief with hook patterns and narrative beats, 5 derivative posts drafted and scheduled, one longform variant for blog or newsletter.
    
- First steps: Pull the post, annotate beats, draft 5 variations, schedule.
    

4. Upwork start plus portfolio anchors
    

- Why: Opens a second lead channel and forces you to codify your best work into case studies.
    
- Definition of Done: Upwork profile complete, 3 case studies published, 5 targeted proposals sent.
    
- First steps: Choose 3 projects for case studies Mustapha pilot, Pharmacy Scraper, Audience Builder GPT. Create one-page outcomes and screenshots. Publish and then submit 5 proposals.
    

5. Content Calendar consolidation
    

- Why: You have two overlapping cards. Finish one usable system instead of two half-built ones.
    
- Merge these: Develop Personal and AHS Content Calendar v2 and Improved Content Calendar.
    
- Definition of Done: One calendar that maps Threads daily posting and IG cadence, plus a repeating weekly prompt.
    
- First steps: Choose the stronger template, migrate content, delete the duplicate.
    

## Park, bundle, or cut for now

Free up focus so the top five ship quickly.

- Park until next sprint: Design and brand my AI avatars using characters, Update ebook to 2025 edition, BookBoost Project, Setup Roth IRA, Review saves for b-roll suggestions.
    
- Bundle into the Audience Builder push: Promote current ThreadWeavers community for FREE and Trip Wire Marketing Campaign.
    
- Close the loop: ThreadWeavers AI Persona SOP got feedback. Capture the top three edits in a single follow-up task, otherwise park.
    

## Resolve blockers fast

- Upwork – Start is blocked. Add a subtask list with the three case studies and the five proposals, then move it to In Progress.
    
- Promote ThreadWeavers community for FREE is blocked. Fold it into the Audience Builder sales push so it moves with the same assets and timeline.
    

## WIP limits and board cleanup

- Set WIP limit to 3 in In Progress. Finish before starting new.
    
- Merge duplicate calendar cards. Move anything not tied to revenue or portfolio into a “Later” column.
