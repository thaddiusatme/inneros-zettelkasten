Here are 5 viral-style Facebook threads you could use around “Myths vs Reality: Moroccan food is more than couscous and tagines.”

---

**Thread 1**

- **Opening Hook:** If you think Moroccan food is just couscous and tagines, you’re missing 90% of the story.
    
- **Individual Steps:**
    

1. Myth: Couscous is eaten daily. Reality: It’s a Friday ritual dish.
    
2. Myth: Tagine is the national dish. Reality: It’s a style of cooking, not a single dish.
    
3. Myth: Moroccan food is always spicy. Reality: It’s rich in spices, but rarely “hot.”
    
4. Myth: Moroccan desserts are just baklava. Reality: From chebakia to sellou, pastries have their own identity.
    
5. Myth: Moroccan meals are heavy. Reality: Salads, lentils, and beans are staples of everyday life.

Would you like me to shape these more for **locals** (educating Moroccans about forgotten dishes) or for an **international audience** (breaking stereotypes for travelers)?
