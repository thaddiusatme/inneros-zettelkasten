## Thought  
## **ðŸ“‹ PROJECT MANIFEST: Knowledge Capture System**

### **Project Overview**

**Name:** Knowledge Capture System (KCS)  
**Purpose:** Transform mobile screenshots and voice notes into connected knowledge within a Zettelkasten system  
**Primary User:** Individual knowledge worker using Samsung S23 + MacBook  
**Success Metric:** Screenshots no longer accumulate unprocessed; captured insights integrate into content creation workflow

### **Problem Statement**

- User captures 50+ screenshots weekly across mobile/desktop
- Screenshots pile up in device folders without processing
- Valuable insights are lost in "capture graveyards"
- No connection between visual captures and existing knowledge base
- Mobile capture is 90% of flow but has zero processing capability

### **Solution Architecture**

```
CAPTURE LAYER (Mobile)
â”œâ”€â”€ Samsung S23: Screenshots + Voice Notes
â”œâ”€â”€ Auto-sync: OneDrive
â””â”€â”€ Zero friction: No apps, no processing

PROCESSING LAYER (Desktop)
â”œâ”€â”€ Temporal Matching: Pair screenshots with voice notes
â”œâ”€â”€ OCR Extraction: Text from images
â”œâ”€â”€ AI Enhancement: Tags, connections, quality scoring
â””â”€â”€ Zettelkasten Integration: Link to existing notes

KNOWLEDGE LAYER (Output)
â”œâ”€â”€ Capture Notes: Image + annotation + metadata
â”œâ”€â”€ Fleeting Notes: Quick insights
â”œâ”€â”€ Permanent Notes: Synthesized knowledge
â””â”€â”€ Content Creation: Blog posts, videos, presentations
```

### **Core Features**

#### **1. Proximity Pairing**

- Match screenshots with voice notes by timestamp (Â±60 seconds)
- No manual linking required
- Graceful handling of unpaired captures

#### **2. Desktop Processing Station**

- Full-screen image review
- OCR text extraction
- Voice transcription
- AI-suggested connections to existing notes
- Quality filtering (keeper/temporary)

#### **3. Knowledge Integration**

- Embed images in markdown notes
- Preserve visual + textual content
- Auto-link to Zettelkasten vault
- Support claims/quotes extraction

### **Technical Requirements**

#### **Infrastructure**

- OneDrive sync for Samsung â†’ MacBook pipeline
- Python 3.8+ for processing scripts
- OCR capability (Tesseract or cloud service)
- Voice transcription (Whisper or cloud service)
- Markdown note system (Obsidian compatible)

#### **File Paths**

```
Screenshots: /Users/thaddius/Library/CloudStorage/OneDrive-Personal/backlog/Pictures/Samsung Gallery/DCIM/Screenshots
Voice Notes: /Users/thaddius/Library/CloudStorage/OneDrive-Personal/Voice Recorder
Knowledge Base: ~/inneros/notes/captures/
```

#### **Metadata Schema**

```yaml
type: capture
captured: 2025-01-22 14:35:12
device: Samsung S23
source_url: https://example.com (if detected)
voice_note: Recording_20250122_143528.m4a
transcription: "This connects to my CAP theorem research"
ocr_text: "Extracted text from image..."
quality_score: 0.75
tags: [distributed-systems, eventual-consistency]
connections: [[CAP Theorem]], [[System Design]]
```

### **Development Phases**

#### **Phase 1: Foundation** (Week 1-2)

- Set up OneDrive sync monitoring
- Build timestamp matching algorithm
- Create basic capture note template
- Manual processing workflow

#### **Phase 2: Intelligence** (Week 3-4)

- Integrate OCR (Tesseract/API)
- Add voice transcription (Whisper)
- Implement AI suggestions (OpenAI/Claude API)
- Connection discovery to existing notes

#### **Phase 3: Workflow** (Week 5-6)

- Weekly review integration
- Batch processing interface
- Quality filtering system
- Archive management

#### **Phase 4: Scale** (Week 7-8)

- Performance optimization for 100+ captures
- Advanced matching algorithms
- Content creation templates
- Analytics dashboard

### **Success Criteria**

1. Process 80% of captures within one week of creation
2. 50% of captures generate notes (fleeting or permanent)
3. 10+ connections discovered weekly to existing knowledge
4. Screenshots searchable by visual and textual content
5. Content creation velocity increases by 25%

## **ðŸš€ PROOF OF CONCEPT MANIFEST**

### **POC Overview**

**Name:** Capture Matcher MVP  
**Timeline:** 1 week  
**Goal:** Validate screenshot+voice pairing workflow with minimal code

### **Scope**

#### **IN SCOPE:**

- Screenshot + voice note temporal matching
- Basic desktop processing interface
- Simple markdown note creation
- Manual workflow validation

#### **OUT OF SCOPE:**

- OCR extraction
- Voice transcription
- AI suggestions
- Automated monitoring
- Mobile app development

### **Technical Implementation**

#### **Core Script: `capture_matcher.py`**

```python
"""
Matches screenshots with voice notes based on timestamp proximity
and provides interactive processing interface
"""

Features:
- Scan OneDrive folders for recent captures
- Match files within 60-second window
- Display matched pairs for review
- Open screenshot + play voice note
- Create basic markdown note with annotation
```

#### **File Structure**

```
inneros-capture-poc/
â”œâ”€â”€ capture_matcher.py      # Main processing script
â”œâ”€â”€ requirements.txt        # Python dependencies (minimal)
â”œâ”€â”€ README.md              # Setup instructions
â””â”€â”€ test_captures/         # Sample files for testing
```

#### **Dependencies**

```txt
# requirements.txt
pathlib  # Built-in
datetime # Built-in
subprocess # Built-in
```

### **POC Workflow**

#### **Day 1-2: Environment Setup**

1. Verify OneDrive sync paths
2. Install Python script
3. Test with existing screenshots
4. Document file naming patterns

#### **Day 3-5: Real Usage Test**

1. Take 10 screenshot+voice pairs
2. Process with script
3. Measure sync latency
4. Refine matching threshold

#### **Day 6-7: Evaluation**

1. Calculate successful match rate
2. Time per capture processing
3. User friction points
4. Note quality assessment

### **Test Scenarios**

#### **Scenario 1: Perfect Pair**

- Screenshot at 14:35:12
- Voice note at 14:35:28
- Expected: Successful match

#### **Scenario 2: Screenshot Only**

- Screenshot without voice
- Expected: Process without transcription

#### **Scenario 3: Multiple Rapid Captures**

- 3 screenshots within 30 seconds
- 2 voice notes
- Expected: Correct pairing logic

#### **Scenario 4: Delayed Voice Note**

- Voice note 2 minutes after screenshot
- Expected: No match (outside threshold)

### **POC Success Metrics**

1. **Match Accuracy:** >90% correct pairings
2. **Processing Time:** <30 seconds per capture
3. **User Satisfaction:** Would use daily (yes/no)
4. **Technical Validation:** Sync latency acceptable (<5 min)

### **POC Deliverables**

1. Working Python script with paths configured
2. 20+ processed test captures
3. Performance metrics document
4. Go/No-Go recommendation for full build

### **Risk Mitigation**

- **Risk:** OneDrive sync too slow
    - **Mitigation:** Test alternative cloud providers
- **Risk:** Timestamp matching unreliable
    - **Mitigation:** Add manual pairing option
- **Risk:** Voice notes wrong format
    - **Mitigation:** Test multiple recording apps

### **Next Steps After POC**

If successful:

1. Add OCR capability
2. Integrate voice transcription
3. Build connection discovery
4. Create desktop UI

If unsuccessful:

1. Identify blocking issues
2. Test alternative approaches
3. Consider simpler workflow
