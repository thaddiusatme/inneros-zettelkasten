**Thread 1**

- **Opening Hook:** The best chefs don’t just cook food. They carry stories from their ancestors and remix them for the next generation.
    
- **Individual Steps:**
    
    1. Learn the _why_ behind a dish before changing the _how_.
        
    2. Swap ingredients with intention, not convenience.
        
    3. Preserve the cooking method even if flavors evolve.
        
    4. Highlight the origin every time you share the dish.
        
    5. Invite family elders to taste-test your modern version.
        
    6. Keep cultural spices intact—experiment around them, never erase them.
        
    7. Share both the traditional and the modern recipe side by side.
