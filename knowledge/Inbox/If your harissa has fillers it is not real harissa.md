**Thread 1**

- **Opening Hook:** If your harissa has fillers, you’re not eating harissa. You’re eating marketing.
    
- **Individual Steps:**
    
    1. Real harissa is just chilies, garlic, olive oil, salt, and spices. Nothing else.
        
    2. Fillers like tomato paste, sugar, or starch dilute the punch of true harissa.
        
    3. Authentic harissa burns slow and deep, not sugary-sweet.
        
    4. The flavor should build on your tongue, not coat it with syrup.
        
    5. Always check the label—if you see more than 6 ingredients, walk away.

**Thread 2**

- **Opening Hook:** 95% of store-bought harissa is fake. Here’s how to spot the real thing.
    
- **Individual Steps:**
    
    1. Ingredient #1 should be chili peppers, not tomato paste.
        
    2. No sugar. No fillers. No preservatives.
        
    3. Authentic recipes use caraway and cumin for depth.
        
    4. Olive oil preserves freshness, not cheap vegetable oils.
        
    5. The texture should be rich and paste-like, not watery.
        
    6. If it tastes like ketchup with heat, it’s not harissa.

**Thread 3**

- **Opening Hook:** They won’t tell you this, but fake harissa is everywhere—and it’s ruining your food.
    
- **Individual Steps:**
    
    1. Real harissa comes from Tunisia, with centuries of tradition.
        
    2. The industrial versions cut costs by adding cheap fillers.
        
    3. True harissa has complexity: smoky, tangy, and floral.
        
    4. Fake harissa tastes flat because the chilies are watered down.
        
    5. You’re paying for branding, not authenticity.
        
    6. Support small-batch makers if you want the real experience.

**Thread 4**

- **Opening Hook:** Here’s the brutal truth: most “harissa” in stores would never pass in Tunisia.
    
- **Individual Steps:**
    
    1. Authentic harissa recipes are protected cultural heritage.
        
    2. If it contains tomato paste, it’s been westernized.
        
    3. Industrial brands hide fillers with flashy labels.
        
    4. The spice balance is key—real harissa sings, fake harissa shouts.
        
    5. Learn to read ingredient lists like a detective.
        
    6. If you want the true taste, either make it yourself or buy from trusted artisanal producers.
