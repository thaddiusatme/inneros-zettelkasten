## The prompt
Let's create a new branch for the next feature: prompt.
We want to perform TDD with red, green, refactor phases, followed by git commit and lessons learned documentation. This equals one iteration.

Updated Execution Plan (focused P0/P1): 
I'm following the guidance in  (critical path: ).
