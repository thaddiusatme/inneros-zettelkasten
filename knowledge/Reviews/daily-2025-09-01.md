Here’s your stand up for 9-1.

# Daily Note — 2025-09-01

## Focus

- Finalize ThreadWeavers funnel map and decide free vs tripwire entry
    
- Lock Sprint 3 priorities and first two deep work blocks
    
- Draft sales page outline for the $27 Starter Kit
    

## Standup

- Yesterday:
    
    - Wrapped Sprint 2 retro and planning
        
    - Built out parts of the content calendar and newsletter schema
        
    - Clarified funnel paths and scoped work where things felt unclear
        
- Today:
    
    - Update Link in Bio hub options and tripwire path in the funnel map
        
    - Write sales page skeleton: hook, promise, proof, offer, CTA
        
    - Define Sprint 3 top outcomes and schedule two 90-minute blocks
        
- Blockers:
    
    - Decision fatigue on free hub vs tripwire emphasis
        
    - Low energy after work and lingering anxiety about momentum
        

## Links Added

- Funnel flowchart drafts for Tripwire and Hub pages — why it matters: gives a shared source of truth for copy and CTAs
    
- Newsletter schema notes in Airtable — why it matters: supports distribution from one editorial source
    

## Wins

- Completed shift and still made time to scope the funnel
    
- Identified clear next actions for sales page and workshop path
    
- Reconfirmed offer ladder logic ($27 → $97 waitlist → $197 call)
    

## Next

- Write the landing page hero section and 5 objections with responses
    
- Choose the primary CTA for Link in Bio (Newsletter or $27) and document the why
    
- Block two deep work sessions on the calendar for funnel copy and Airtable hookups
    

## Journal

Felt a bit stalled, but mapping the funnel exposed exactly where copy needs to work. Momentum comes from shipping the sales page outline and making one clear CTA decision.

## EOD Micro Retro

- What moved the needle: Consolidating funnel paths and defining the next three copy tasks
    
- What felt hard: Picking between free-first vs tripwire-first without overthinking
    
- What to change tomorrow: Make the CTA decision first, then write with a timer and stop at done, not perfect
