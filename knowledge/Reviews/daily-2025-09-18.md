# Daily Note — 2025-09-18

- Drafted 2 long-form articles, but quality wasn’t there → abandoned drafts.
- Fell back on reruns, which put you **2 weeks ahead on Threads content** (distribution cadence back on track).
- Newsletter already shipped earlier today.
- Unwinding early to prep for WFM work stretch (Fri + Sat, 6a–2:30p).
## ⚠️ Observations

- Content quality from AI felt “slop” → energy drain. Might need a different prompting/workflow for cornerstone articles.
- Funnel validation (checkout, tags, analytics) untouched today → backlog pressure for Sprint 4
## 🧭 Plan Forward

**Fri 9/19 & Sat 9/20 (WFM 6–2:30)**
- Keep business load light → micro tasks only (journal, 1 funnel test, or quick tag wiring if energy allows).
- Prioritize rest after shifts.

**Sun 9/21 (Day off)*
- Recharge with friends/family, early bed.
- Light planning in evening for next maker push (Mon).

**Mon 9/22 (next maker day)**
- Target Funnel Validation Sprint Criteria:
    - Test checkout logged.
    - Wire GHL tags (at least baseline Tripwire vs Free).
    - Optional: analytics event check.
## Journal
You re-secured **distribution runway** (2 weeks on Threads). Even if the long-form drafts didn’t click, you’re still feeding your content cadence, which was slipping.
