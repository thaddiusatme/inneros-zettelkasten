Here you go. I kept it tight, aligned to Sprint 3, and timeboxed around your WFM shift.

# Daily Note â€” 2025-09-12

## Focus

- Move the funnel forward: confirmation email draft and automation skeleton
- Clear the battery errand so it stops taxing attention
- Light content batch to keep distribution warm

## Today Board (Fri 9/12)
**Must Do**
- WFM shift 6:00a to 12:30p
- Battery errand
- Confirmation email draft for ThreadWeavers Starter Kit
- Automation skeleton wired to checkout event

**Should Do**
- Brit quick check-in for pending tickets or approvals
- Landing page copy outline tighten pa

**Could Do**
- Clean room 15 minute reset
- Draft 2 to 3 social posts for next week

## Timeboxed Plan
- 12:30 to 1:10 Lunch and reset
- 1:10 to 2:10 Battery errand
- 2:20 to 3:50 Maker block: confirmation email copy first, then set up trigger in your platform
- 3:50 to 4:05 Short break

- 4:45 to 5:00 Brit check-in and ticket skim

## Task Details

**Confirmation email**
- DoR: offer name, price, receipt text, access or next steps
- DoD: email fires on successful checkout, test email received, links work

**Automation skeleton**
- DoR: event name mapped, destination list or tag chosen
- DoD: checkout event triggers the confirmation email and applies a tag or list, test proves both
    
**Landing page copy tighten pass**
- DoR: current outline open
- DoD: final H1, subhead, bullets for value and a clear CTA

**Social content mini batch**
- DoR: topics pulled from funnel page and FAQ
- DoD: 2 to 3 drafts saved in Content DB with target publish windows
    

## Acceptance Criteria Tracker

## Blocker
