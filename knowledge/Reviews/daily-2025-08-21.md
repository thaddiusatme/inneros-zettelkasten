# Daily Note — 2025-08-21

## Focus
**Single theme:** Finalize the CTA path from Audience Builder GPT → **one offer** (default suggestion: ThreadWeavers Free) and ship it across the PDF + GPT flow.

## Standup
- Lead magnet: Audience Builder GPT PDF ~90% complete as the TW resource/lead magnet.
- Systemizing: Built Obsidian templates to support the workflow.
- Distribution: Published social posts.

**Suggested note to connect:** [[lit-20250821-1952-audience-avatar.md]] — captures where the Audience Builder GPT hands off to your chosen offer and the copy variants you’ve tested.=
## Next
1. **Decide CTA destination + write final microcopy** (15–25m)  
    _End state:_ Offer selected; 2–3 line CTA + button text finalized.
    
2. **Drop CTA into the PDF and export v1.0** (20–30m)  
    _End state:_ PDF v1.0 with CTA block; file saved and versioned.
    
3. **Wire CTA into the GPT flow** (25–35m)  
    _End state:_ Post-answer message/CTA card implemented; tested on 3 prompts.
    
4. **Promo burst for ThreadWeavers Free: draft & schedule 3 posts** (30–40m)  
    _End state:_ 3 posts queued in your scheduler; links tracked.
    
5. **Mustapha campaign: 1-page brief** (25–35m)  
    _End state:_ Objective, ICP, 5-post outline, CTA; doc saved.
    
6. **Contact list pilot: 10-record sample from GMaps list** (20–30m)  
    _End state:_ CSV with 10 quality entries + compliance checklist noted.
## Journal

## EOD Micro Retro — Aug 21, 2025

**What shipped:** none  
**Friction:** not enough time; too much context switching  
**Tweak for tomorrow (Fri 6–12 Whole Foods):** finish today’s CTA work, start Mustapha’s campaign, and test email scrapers

**Momentum summary:** No ship today, but the targets are clear. With a half-day window tomorrow, finish the CTA path first, then make one tight kickoff move on Mustapha and a small scraper test to keep traction.

**Next (Tomorrow’s top 3 — 15–45 min actions)**

1. **Finish CTA in the PDF & export v1.0** (30–40m)  
    _End state:_ PDF v1.0 saved with CTA block and button text finalized.
    
2. **Wire CTA into the GPT flow & test** (25–35m)  
    _End state:_ Post-answer CTA live; tested on 3 prompts; clicks tracked.
    
3. **Mustapha kickoff + scraper smoke test** (35–45m)  
    _End state:_ 1-page brief (objective, ICP, 5-post outline) **and** a 10-record scraper test CSV with accuracy % and notes.
