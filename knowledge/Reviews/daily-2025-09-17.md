Here’s a clean stand-up note for **9-17**, framed in your PKM style and tied to Sprint 4 priorities:

---

# Daily Note — 2025-09-17

## Focus

- Finish and schedule 9/18 newsletter (visuals + polish).
- Map missing GHL tags for funnel (free + tripwire).
- Protect energy, pace work across maker blocks.

---

## Standup

**Yesterday (9/16)**

- WFM shift 12–4.
- Property manager conversation → de-escalated.
- Newsletter: stories drafted, base complete.
- Funnel: 7-email confirmation flow for free version drafted.
- Vibe-coded Zettelkasten system.

**Today (9/17)**

- Day off from WFM → maker focus.
- Morning: newsletter visuals + styling.
- Midday: create tag mapping doc (Free, Tripwire, Newsletter, Upsell, Consult).
- Afternoon: optional funnel action (analytics or landing page).
- Evening: light reset/journal.

**Blockers**

- Property stress hangover.
- No tagging wired yet for tripwire/free flows → must be scoped this sprint.
