Wanted to be a architect->  loves design
In Morroco got into experiemnetal sciences
when he went to America, had no acess to college, no money
in his mind, was fascinated by art

BUT at the same time, worked with food.
Something in the family

Its in the genes
When he had an oppurtunity

After, Mustapha realized that he had a fasincation with recipes and cookbooks

Went to Morroco after fixing his papers, visits his family and ended up at an olive orchard

Olive Orchard - Wanted to make olive oil from scratch

Managed to get olive oil here to USA, sampled their olive oil to a local chef and he wanted more

He was a distributer.


--- We get to see the humanity of the sauce

There was no gourmet food industry in Morroco


 production and sourcing was hard. 
Eventually found a source

Virgin oil versus producing their own


--- No one would sell Mustapha olives]


Note to self - we should consider how hard it is to be an business person in Morocco. 
- they couldnt even pick when they wanted

---
Sauce + Olive Oil = Harrissa
