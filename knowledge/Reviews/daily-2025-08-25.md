# Daily Note — 2025-08-25

## Focus
- Conserve energy post–WFM shift  
- Attend 3 p.m. law firm interview (decompression + networking)  
- Maintain client reliability with Mustapha update  

---

## Standup
- **Yesterday:**  
  - Shot list finalized  
  - 2 Veronica GPT posts polished  
  - Content calendar skeleton drafted  

- **Today:**  
  - Law firm interview (15:00)  
  - Leadership coaching prep (planned, not completed)  
  - Finalize ThreadWeavers sales page (planned, not completed)  
  - Mustapha campaign — quick communication with sample posts  

- **Blockers:**  
  - Fatigue after 8-hour WFM shift  
  - Low motivation after interview outcome  

---

## Links Added
- [[Mustapha Social Campaign Update]] — client reliability proof, keeps portfolio track alive  
- [[ThreadWeavers Sales Page]] — not touched today, backlog carry-over  
- [[Law Firm Interview 2025-08-25]] — logged as exploration, not a fit (degree required)  

---

## Wins
- Attended law firm interview → confirmed not pursuing degree-gated roles  
- Sent quick Mustapha update with early content samples → maintained client trust  

---

## Next
1. Write micro-launch emails 1–2 (Tue AM)  
2. Draft 3 Threads posts (Tue AM)  
3. Analyze viral post + outline hook patterns (Tue PM)

## Journal
The interview felt like a dud — they wanted a college transcript, which I don’t have and don’t want to chase. It reinforced my choice to focus on AI, freelancing, and content systems instead of trying to squeeze into a mold that doesn’t fit.  

Energy after Whole Foods was low. I didn’t get to the sales page or coaching prep. But I *did* send Mustapha a quick update with draft samples, which felt like the right “small proof” to keep moving.

## EOD Micro Retro
- **What moved the needle:** Mustapha client update (early proof, reliability maintained).  
- **What felt hard:** Switching gears after an 8-hour WFM shift. The interview drained momentum.  
- **What to change tomorrow:** Protect AM deep work for micro-launch assets; keep PM blocks lighter and more tactical.
