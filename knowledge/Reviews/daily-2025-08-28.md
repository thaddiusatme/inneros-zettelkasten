# Daily Note — 2025-08-28

## Focus
- Deliver visible progress at Brit’s office session (M365 onboarding + ops support).    
- Advance Mustapha’s sauce campaign polish.
- Push content calendar toward v1 (platform + newsletter tables).

## Standup

- **Yesterday:**
    - Newsletter sent and published on time.
    - Polished Mustapha’s campaign with first deep research pass.
    - Updated sprint goals to explicitly include Brit + Mustapha.
    - Started content calendar restructuring.
- **Today:**
    - 3–4 hour Brit office session: M365 admin, onboarding guide v0, ops workflow notes, visible outputs.
    - Apply Perplexity + Claude polish to Mustapha’s hooks.
    - Expand content calendar with platform-specific + newsletter tables.
- **Blockers:**
    - Limited work session window at Brit’s → need disciplined pacing.
    - Context switching between Brit deliverables + marketing engine work.
## Deep Work Block Plan – Aug 28 (Evening)

### **Step 1 – Build Test Samples (3 Days of Work)**

**Goal:** Have 3 skeleton → approved posts flow through the system so you can stress-test the schema and automation.

1. **Mustapha’s Sauce (3 posts)** In Progress
    
    - Pick one idea per pillar.
        
    - Draft thread copy + CTA.
        
    - Approve → push into **Threads table**.
        
    - Fill platform-specific fields (hashtags, captions for IG Carousels/Reels).
        
2. **AI Humble Servant (3 posts)** Planned
    
    - Pull 3 ideas from your Zettelkasten.
    
    - Enter into **Master Editorial** → skeleton → approved.
        
    - Watch automation create platform records.
        
3. **Cross-check**
    
    - Ensure records link correctly across **Threads, IG, FB, Newsletter**.
        
    - Confirm status fields sync (“Approved” → “In Production”).

### **Step 2 – Content Calendar Buildout**

**Goal:** Lock in the infrastructure so scaling to more posts/brands is smooth.

- **Editorial table check:** Make sure every field matches schema (pillar, format, CTA, approval, target_publish_date).
    
- **Platform table check:** Standardize names (status, scheduled_date, post_url). - Done
    
- **Automation:** Build one Airtable automation: - Planned
    - Trigger: `Approval = Approved`.
    - Action: Create records in platform tables.
    - Update Master Editorial → Status = In Production.
        
- **Calendar view:** Create a **calendar or timeline view** in Airtable for scheduled_date across platforms.
    
- **Documentation:** Quick notes in your project manifest: “Iteration 1 complete: 3 post test, automation runs successfully.”

## Journal

Energy focused today on protecting Brit’s time and getting tangible outputs in his office. Framing Brit + Mustapha as protected clients is already helping with decision-making. Important to keep ThreadWeavers + Scraper in sight but not let them crowd out today’s commitments.

## EOD Micro Retro – Aug 28
**What moved the needle:**
- Delivered real client value at Brit’s office → Device Maintenance SOP, Windows 11 Upgrade Manifest, Calendly issue report, and hands-on surface updates.
- Clarified **content calendar schema v3.0** and project manifest → now have direction for Iteration 1 test posts.
- Did strategic work (SWOT + RICE) to keep content system aligned with product/sprint goals.
    

**What felt hard:*
- Balancing deep buildout work with the reality of your **early WFM shifts** (energy and time constraints).
- The **content calendar** progress feels slower than expected — tables partly built, but not yet tested end-to-end.
- Splitting focus between **Brit’s IT work** and your **own content engine** made it harder to close loops fully.
    

**What to change tomorrow:*
- Keep **Brit’s client work (Wispr Flow install + onboarding, surface maintenance)** as the **top priority** after WFM.
- Scope **content calendar work tightly** (finish tables + run 1 automation test) instead of chasing too many posts.//////////////////
- Protect recovery time so Saturday/Sunday can be productive sprint closers.
