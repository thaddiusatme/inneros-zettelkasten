# Daily Note — 2025-08-26

## Focus

- Balance WFM shift + business tasks.
- Progress on Mustapha’s calendar, content calendar prep, and newsletter.
- Keep journaling + sprint clarity consistent.
    

## Standup

- **Yesterday:** Wrapped Sprint 2 doc updates, kept up with journaling.
- **Today:** WFM shift 10–4, Mustapha calendar v0 build, content calendar prep/project planning, newsletter research + outline, journaling.
- **Blockers:** Burnout signals, frustration around partner dynamics, limited time outside WFM.
    

## Wins

- Mustapha social media calendar v0 complete.
- Content calendar refactor + prep started.
- Newsletter **research + outline finished** → only edits + visuals left.
- Positive WFM 60-day check-in → opened door to FT benefits conversation.
- Midday journaling and notes captured.
    

## Next

- Perplexity + Claude pass on Mustapha’s calendar.
- Formalize content calendar SOP/manifest in Airtable.
- Add illustrations + video snippets, polish + edit newsletter draft (due Thursday).
- Protect 2-hr block tomorrow for newsletter finalization.
## Journal

Woke up irritable — partner micromanagement triggers frustration. WFM shift ate into energy but 60-day check-in went well, and I left feeling good about trajectory. Mustapha work + content calendar planning gave me momentum, and newsletter outline is ready to finish. Big picture: I’m moving projects forward even on lower-energy days.

## EOD Micro Retro

**What moved the needle:**

- Mustapha calendar v0 with hooks + instructions.
- Content calendar prep + planning for all brands.
- Newsletter research + outline done → draft nearly ready.
- WFM 60-day check-in, expressed FT interest.
- Sprint 2 doc clarity improved.
    

**What felt hard:**

- Morning irritability, burnout edges, partner tension.
- Balancing WFM 10–4 shift with business progress.
- WFM reporting/metrics loops.

**What to change tomorrow:**

- Use buffer rituals (walk, breathwork, Pomodoro resets) to reset mornings.
- Guard 2-hr newsletter block.
- Keep WFM + business tasks separate.
- Track “light wins” to stay out of burnout mindset.
- Formalize content calendar SOP so prep turns into action.
