# üîÅ Sprint 1 Retrospective
## ‚úÖ What Went Well
- Work life balance improving. Saying no more often and it is paying off
- ThreadWeavers AI Persona SOP got useful feedback
- Audience Builder GPT SOP shipped
- Link in bio now points to ThreadWeavers GHL community
- InnerOS survived rapid changes and is starting to feel cohesive
- One post went viral. We should analyze it and build a repeatable storytelling pattern
    - Target cadence
        - Threads: 10-20 per day North star
        - Facebook: 10 daily touch points across profile, page, comments, and replies
        - Facebook Groups: 2 to 3 posts or helpful replies across relevant groups
        - Instagram: 1 feed post daily plus casual stories
## ‚ö†Ô∏è What Didn‚Äôt Go Well
- Missed deliverable for Brit. Lost 100 dollars but protected sanity
- Over engineered InnerOS and sunk time into tinkering
- Still not publishing at the desired volume
## üîß What To Improve (Process/Tools)
- Smoother flow between Notion, ChatGPT, and Obsidian. Reading highlights should flow into notes and then into content
    - Proposed flow
        1. Capture highlights and article links
        2. Create Obsidian Fleeting Note with YAML tags
        3. Promote to Permanent Note with 3 takeaways and 2 story angles
        4. Send to Notion Content DB as ideas ready to draft
        5. ChatGPT turns each idea into 1 hook and 1 post
- Fix this sprint retro template so it is faster to complete
## üìà MVP Metrics
- Content published: 28
- Leads created: 2 
- Days of consistency (streak): 295
- Sentiment 1 to 5: 3, with a recent viral spike
**Targets for next sprint**
- Threads: 50 to 70 posts total minimum
- Instagram: 1 feed posts plus daily stories
- Facebook: 3 helpful comments or posts total
- Leads created: 4
- Sentiment: 4
## üß≠ Decisions & Rationale
- Prioritize distribution over tinkering
    - Limit InnerOS refactors to a single 90 minute block per week
- Make Threads the engine, everything else is repurposed
    - Batch 2 days per week to create 80 percent of posts
- Institutionalize the viral story format
    - Publish 4 to 7 narrative posts per week that follow the viral structure    
- Keep monetization front and center
    - Keep link in bio pointed to ThreadWeavers GHL community and pin a benefits driven post
- Protect client work
    - Add a 24 hour rule to acknowledge tasks and a simple SLA board so nothing slips
