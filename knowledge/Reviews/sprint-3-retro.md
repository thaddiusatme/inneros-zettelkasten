# 🔁 Sprint 3 Retrospective

## ✅ What Went Well
- Confirmation email drafted and tested successfully.
- Mustapha’s social content delivered (met promise, campaign underway).
- Newsletter cadence held (issues on 9/4 and 9/11 sent).
- Social content ideation expanded (hooks, carousels, image briefs).
- WFM shifts respected, work boundaries held.

## ⚠️ What Didn’t Go Well
- Funnel core not fully live: landing page + checkout setup stalled.
- Analytics validation deferred; no test checkout logged.
- Distribution cadence weaker than planned (not a full week of posts).
- Personal backlog (room cleaning, eBay bag) slipped off radar.

## 🔧 What To Improve (Process/Tools)
- Treat “offer alignment” (free vs. paid funnel) as a front-burner task, not backlog noise.
- Schedule newsletter work on Wednesday mornings (to hit 8am release without scramble).
- Use stricter WIP limits on client tasks—keep Mustapha/Brit support bounded.
- Mid-sprint check-ins should be firmer (Day 7 guardrail missed).

## 📈 MVP Metrics
- Content published: 2 newsletters, ~5–7 social posts (not full week).
- Leads created: minimal (no funnel live → no conversion data).
- Days of consistency (streak): 6–7 days with some activity, but breaks in posting.
- Sentiment (1–5): 3 → mix of good energy (progress, client trust) and frustration (funnel stalled).

## 🧭 Decisions & Rationale
- Deferred portfolio/Audience Builder GPT to Sprint 4+ (per guardrails).
- Accepted commission-only model for Mustapha ($2/bottle) instead of retainer—fit current client cashflow.
- Decided to move Brit’s support into “maintenance lane,” not sprint scope.
- Paused on defining free vs. paid funnel access—recognized as core blocker to solve next.

## 📌 Actions (in-note only)
- [ ] Clarify funnel offer strategy before Sprint 4 planning finalization.
- [ ] Block out Wednesday AM for newsletter production.
- [ ] Update sprint guardrails to elevate “offer alignment” as a deliverable.
- [ ] Draft recovery plan for distribution cadence (batch posts).
- [ ] Clear at least one personal backlog item (room or eBay bag) to reduce drag.
