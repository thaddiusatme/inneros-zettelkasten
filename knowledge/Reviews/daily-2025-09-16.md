# Daily Note — 2025-09-16

## Focus

- Stay steady after the property stress — protect energy.
- Move funnel one small step forward (ThreadWeavers).
- Keep newsletter cadence on track for Wed 8 AM release.

---

## Standup
**Yesterday**
- Sent 9/15 newsletter on time.
- Spoke with Mustapha (4:30) → clarified social media obligations.
- Completed confirmation email draft.
**Today**

- Morning: chores done, property manager conversation (Matt).
- Midday: WFM shift 12–4.
- Evening: 45–60 min funnel task + light reset.

**Blockers**
- Emotional energy drained from property issues.
- Burnout risk if I overcommit.

## Today Board

**Must Do (non-negotiable)**
- WFM shift 12–4.
- Draft Wed 9/17 newsletter (so it’s staged for 8 AM).

**Should Do (important)**
- One funnel validation task: run/test checkout OR update 1 social bio with funnel link.
- Quick client check for Brit (tickets, tech support).

**Could Do (if energy left)**
- Log 1 distribution post in Content DB.
- Room reset (15 min declutter).

---

## Wins (so far)
- Advocated directly with property manager (Matt).
- De-escalated from initial anger.

---

## Next
- Use post-WFM maker block for one funnel action + newsletter prep.
- Journal or decompress if stress spikes again.
