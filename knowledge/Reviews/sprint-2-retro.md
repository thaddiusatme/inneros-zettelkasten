# 🔁 Sprint 2 Retrospective

## ✅ What Went Well
- Maintenance tasks for Brit finished smoothly.
- Content calendar workflow (editorial → newsletter/threads) is now streamlined.
- Established repeatable deep work samples for testing cadence. → Action: document as SOP for future sprints.
- Clear sales collateral drafted for Pharmacy Scraper next phase (helped sharpen sales narrative).

## ⚠️ What Didn’t Go Well
- Context-switching between Brit, Mustapha, and ThreadWeavers diluted focus.
- Funnel deliverables (landing page, checkout, confirmation) not shipped — core Sprint 2 objective missed.
- Portfolio work (case studies, Work with me page, outreach) not delivered; timeboxing slipped.
- Social content engine still mid-build; cadence baseline not established.

## 🔧 What To Improve (Process/Tools)
- Enforce strict timeboxing: 2 × 60 min portfolio sessions, no more.
- Define and track “increment shipped” more clearly (working funnel, live case study, live page).
- Stand up an SLA board for Brit/client work → keeps it visible but contained.
- Close loops faster in editorial → distribution flow; reduce prep-only manifests.

## 📈 MVP Metrics
- Content published: 0 increments (Threads/IG posts not logged as baseline).
- Leads created: 0 (no funnel traffic/sales yet).
- Days of consistency (streak): 3 deep work test days logged.
- Sentiment (1–5): 3 → progress but missed sprint acceptance criteria.

## 🧭 Decisions & Rationale
- Prioritized manifests and backend setup over visible increments → rationale was “laying groundwork,” but tradeoff cost the sprint goal.
- Pharmacy Scraper collateral developed as a revenue hedge, but not aligned with Sprint 2 scope → decision to pursue short-term cash option.
- Deferred Audience Builder GPT focus to keep ThreadWeavers + portfolio as the primary tracks.

## 📌 Actions (in-note only)
- [ ] Draft SOP for 3-day deep work cadence block.
- [ ] Ship Work with me one-pager in Sprint 3 (timebox sessions).
- [ ] Publish at least 1 case study with visual + metric in Sprint 3.
- [ ] Launch minimal funnel (landing → checkout → confirmation) with link in bio.
- [ ] Create SLA board for Brit/clients, visible daily.
- [ ] Set content baseline: log 1 week of distribution across Threads/IG/FB.
