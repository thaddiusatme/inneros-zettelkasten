# Daily Note — 2025-08-29

# Daily Scrum – 8/29

## Yesterday (8/28)

- Reviewed **data schema + project manifest v3.0** to guide system buildout.
- Built out the separate tables (not yet finished per manifest).
- Focused on Brit’s office tasks (device maintenance, Windows 11 project manifest, Calendly/Outlook issue research).
- Performed SWOT analysis for alignment with product goals + Scrum goals.
- Identified Deep Work Block focus: 3-day test sample for the calendar.
- Defined tomorrow’s priorities: Wispr Flow onboarding doc, surface maintenance, and client work.
    

## Today (8/29)

- **Top Priorities**
    
    1. Perform Wispr Flow install & onboarding doc for Brit.
    2. Execute surface maintenance task (priority 1).
    3. Progress Deep Work Block (3-day sample test).
    4. Advance buildout of content calendar (tables + master editorial integration).
        
- **Secondary Tasks**
    
    - Update Jira ticket for Brit’s Windows 11 upgrade.
    - Continue social media engagement (Threads, FB groups) to keep baseline distribution moving.
    - Daily Scrum log + EOD recap.
        

## Blockers
- Balancing Whole Foods Market shifts vs. deep focus work.
- Potential time crunch with Brit’s office onsite tasks.
    

## Alignment to Sprint 2 Goals

- **ThreadWeavers Starter Kit funnel**: Content calendar progress → keeps engine on cadence.
- **Audience Builder GPT demand**: Prep positioning for upcoming sales page.
- **Content engine runs on cadence**: Testing 3-day block sample for system reliability.
- **Client work protected**: Wispr Flow + surface maintenance prioritized → 0 missed deliverables.
- **Freelance portfolio**: Capturing case studies from Brit/Mustapha work.
### ✅ To-Do List – Deep Work Block (3-Day Sample Test)

1. **Define Scope & Setup**
    
    -  Select 3 consecutive days to test(9-2 to 9-6)
    -  Document objectives for each day (1-line outcome statement).
        
2. **Day 1 – Content Calendar Buildout**
    
    -  Work on completing separate tables per manifest.
    -  Connect ideation → editorial → platform flow (Obsidian → Master Table → Platform tables).
    -  Mark sample records for review.
        
3. **Day 2 – Editorial Refinement**
    
    -  Flesh out 5–7 pieces of content through Perplexity/Claude polish.
    -  Add metadata (pillar, format, CTA, status) to sample records.
    -  Review alignment with Sprint 2 goals (content cadence).
        
4. **Day 3 – System Integration & Test**
    
    -  Approve 3 sample posts → trigger automation to child platform tables (Threads, IG, FB).
    -  Confirm linkage between Master Editorial & platform tables.
    -  Log test results: Did automations fire? Were statuses updated correctly?
        
5. **Wrap-Up & Reflection**
    
    -  Capture wins, friction points, and adjustments for next cycle.
    -  Write short retro (what worked, what to change)
    -  Store learnings in project manifest v3.0.
