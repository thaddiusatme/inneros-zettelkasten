# Daily Note — 2025-08-18

# Focus
**Theme:** Newsletter kickoff
# Standup

- **Yesterday (rest):** Renne Faire, socializing & connecting.
    
- **Shipped today:**
    
    - WFM errand done
        
    - Ad-hoc support for Brit (time captured)
        
    - Newsletter work initiated
        
- **Blocker:** Client rescheduled to **Tue, Aug 19 @ 2:00pm PT** → **First move:** send 3-bullet agenda + confirm materials needed.
    
    - **Unblock Q (one):** What single outcome must this call achieve?
        

# Next

-  **Newsletter — positioning pass (30 min):** Write audience + promise sentence and 3-section outline; save in ZK note “Newsletter v1 Outline”.
    
-  **Newsletter — draft intro + Section 1 (45 min):** 200–300 words; end with a clear CTA idea.
    
-  **ZK — daily note prompt template (30 min):** Add 5 prompts + checkboxes; set as default template.
    
-  **Client — agenda & confirm (15 min):** Email 3 bullets + ask for any docs ahead of the Tue 2:00pm call.
    
-  **Admin — log & send hours (15 min):** Record today’s support for Brit and share summary.
    
- **Suggested bridge:** Link today’s daily note (“Renne Faire socializing”) → **Weak ties → opportunities** (community/serendipity note).
    

**Time guardrail:** Hard stop at **9:00pm PT**.

1. What actually shipped today?
    
2. One friction I noticed:
    
3. One tweak for tomorrow:
    

**Momentum summary (draft):** You cleared errands, banked paid support with Brit, and got the newsletter moving; tomorrow centers on sharpening the newsletter and nailing the 2pm client call.

-  **Newsletter — Section 2 + CTA draft (45 min):** 300–400 words.
