## **EOD Micro Retro**

**Shipped**

- Audience Builder GPT PDF is live on Beacons.AI 🎉 (conversion optimization needed in future).
    

**Friction**

- Wearing too many hats → low throughput.
    

**Tweak for Tomorrow**

- Narrow focus on content creation (ride the momentum from recent viral posts + regained energy).
    

**Momentum Summary**  
You shipped a major asset live today while juggling multiple contexts. Even though throughput dipped, your viral traction shows strong validation — momentum will compound if you double down on content.

**Next (Tomorrow)**

1. Draft 2–3 content pieces to ride the viral wave + create a FB and Threads cotnent calendar
2. Capture one insight from Audience Builder PDF launch into a note (conversion-focused).
3. Move Mustapha’s campaign forward with one concrete deliverable (a brief outline, design, project manifest of a claendar)
