## Thought  
AI-assisted note-taking could revolutionize how we capture and process ideas. Instead of just storing raw thoughts, we could have AI help with immediate context enrichment, automatic tagging, and connection discovery during the capture phase itself.

## Context  
This idea came up while testing the InnerOS workflow system. Realized that while we have great templates and structure, the capture process could be enhanced with real-time AI assistance.

## Next Steps  
- [ ] Research existing AI note-taking tools
- [ ] Design integration points for LLM assistance during capture
- [ ] Consider privacy implications of AI processing during capture
- [ ] Prototype smart tagging suggestions
