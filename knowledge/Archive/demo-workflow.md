# Neural Network Architecture

Neural networks are computational models inspired by biological neural systems. They consist of interconnected nodes (neurons) organized in layers.

## Basic Components
- Input layer: Receives initial data
- Hidden layers: Process information
- Output layer: Produces final result

## Activation Functions
Common activation functions include ReLU, sigmoid, and tanh. These introduce non-linearity to enable complex pattern learning.
