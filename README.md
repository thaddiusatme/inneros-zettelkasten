    # innerOS ‚Äî Zettelkasten + AI Workflow

    Welcome to the `innerOS` workspace! This vault is designed for frictionless idea capture, structured Zettelkasten note-taking, and AI-assisted workflows, with privacy and future collaboration in mind.

    ## Key Documents
    - **inneros-manifest.md** ‚Äî Comprehensive project overview, architecture, AI features, and roadmap
    - **windsurf-project-changelog.md** ‚Äî Detailed change history and development milestones
    - **project-todo.md** ‚Äî Current priorities and next development steps

    ## Directory Structure
    - `Inbox/` ‚Äî Staging area for new, unsorted notes. All new notes (fleeting, reference, actionable) start here with `status: inbox` in YAML.
    - `Fleeting Notes/` ‚Äî Quick idea capture, triaged for promotion. Only notes with proper YAML frontmatter and `status: inbox` are in the active fleeting workflow.
    - `Permanent Notes/` ‚Äî Atomic, evergreen notes with rich metadata and links.
    - `Templates/` ‚Äî Templater scripts for note creation and automation, now updated with workflow guidance comments.
    - Additional folders: `Content Pipeline/`, `Protocols/`, `Reviews/`, etc.

    ## Note Schema (YAML/Markdown Example)
    ```markdown
    ---
    type: permanent | fleeting | literature | MOC
    created: YYYY-MM-DD HH:mm
    status: inbox | promoted | draft | published
    tags: [permanent, zettelkasten, ...]
    visibility: private | shared | team
    ---
    ```
    - **status: inbox** in YAML is the primary indicator for notes needing triage, regardless of folder location.
    - The `Inbox/` folder is a temporary staging area, not a workflow state.

    ## How Inbox Works
    - All new notes are created in the `Inbox/` folder with `status: inbox` in YAML.
    - During triage (weekly or as needed), notes are moved to their permanent location:
        - Fleeting notes ‚Üí `Fleeting Notes/`
        - Permanent notes ‚Üí `Permanent Notes/`
        - Reference/actionable notes ‚Üí appropriate folder
    - Only notes with `status: inbox` in YAML are considered active for triage, regardless of folder.
    - The `fleeting.md` template (and others) now include workflow guidance comments to reinforce this process.

    ## AI & Automation
    - Templater scripts automate file naming, sorting, and metadata, now with workflow guidance.
    - LLM/AI integration points for summarization, tagging, linking, and triage (see Manifest).
