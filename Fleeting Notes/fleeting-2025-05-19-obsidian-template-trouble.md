# Obsidian Template Trouble

Quick notes on issues with Obsidian templates and potential solutions.

## Problems Encountered
- Templater scripts not consistently applying folder rules
- Date formatting inconsistent between mobile and desktop
- Template variables sometimes not resolving properly
- Difficulty with conditional logic in templates

## Potential Solutions
- Review Templater documentation for folder rules
- Standardize date format across all templates
- Test template variables in isolation
- Create simpler, more robust conditional logic

## Questions
- Is there a better way to handle cross-platform template consistency?
- Should I switch to a different template system?
- How to debug template variable resolution?

## Next Steps
- [ ] Review all templates for consistency
- [ ] Create test cases for each template
- [ ] Document working solutions in an SOP
