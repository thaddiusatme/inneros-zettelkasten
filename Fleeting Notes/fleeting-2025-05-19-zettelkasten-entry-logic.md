# Zettelkasten Entry Logic

Quick thoughts on how to structure the entry points into my Zettelkasten system.

## Ideas
- Need clear rules for when something becomes a permanent note
- Consider entry points: mobile, voice, desktop, browser extension
- Each entry point needs a clear path to permanent note status
- Maybe use templater scripts to standardize the promotion workflow

## Questions
- How to handle voice notes efficiently?
- What's the right balance of structure vs. flexibility?
- Should I auto-tag or manually tag?

## Next Steps
- [ ] Define clear criteria for note promotion
- [ ] Set up templater scripts for each entry point
- [ ] Test the workflow for a week
