## Thought  
I should reconsider my approach for jumping into [[Upwork as Revenue]] for freelance work. I have confidence that I can perform these jobs, a little bit of anxiety because I've never used a platform and I still consider myself somewhat of a novice to intermediate developer. I consider myself an intermediate to advanced project manager, which I think will help me drive more of my success than my actual development skills, which if a project is too complex, I'll just subcontract it.

## Context  
Browsing [[Upwork as Revenue]]

## Next Step  
- [ ] Convert to permanent note?
