# Phase 5 Next Steps - Tomorrow's Action Plan

## 🎯 Where We Left Off (2025-07-25 21:06)

**✅ MAJOR WIN: Git Workflow Discipline Complete**
- Successfully committed ALL uncommitted changes (Permanent & Fleeting Notes)
- 5 major commit batches: MOCs, new notes, standardization, project structure
- All metadata validation passing, pre-commit hooks working perfectly
- Project is now in clean Git state and ready for Phase 5

**✅ Phase 5 Roadmap Complete**
- Comprehensive 8-week implementation plan created
- Technical architecture defined (`.automation/ai/` structure)
- Privacy-first approach with local AI models selected
- Success metrics and risk mitigation strategies in place

## 🚀 Tomorrow's Priority: Phase 5.1 Foundation

**Goal**: Research and select local AI models for smart tagging and summarization

**Specific Actions**:
1. **Research Local LLM Options**
   - Investigate Ollama + Llama 3.1 8B for summarization
   - Research sentence-transformers for embedding/tagging
   - Check system requirements (RAM, GPU, performance)

2. **Set Up Local AI Infrastructure**
   - Install Ollama or similar local LLM runtime
   - Test basic model inference on sample notes
   - Benchmark performance on your hardware

3. **Create AI Configuration System**
   - Design `.automation/ai/config.yaml` structure
   - Plan model storage and caching strategy
   - Define AI feature toggles and settings

## 📋 Context for Tomorrow You

**Why This Matters**: Phase 5 adds intelligent automation to your Zettelkasten while maintaining privacy. All processing happens locally - no external APIs, no data leakage.

**What's Different Now**: Your project has solid foundations from Phases 1-4. Git workflow is disciplined, metadata is standardized, automation stack is operational. Phase 5 builds on this foundation.

**Energy Level Consideration**: After concert + D&D, you might want to start with lighter research tasks rather than heavy coding. Model research and planning are perfect for this.

## 🎵 Post-Concert Energy Management

**If High Energy**: Dive into Ollama installation and model testing
**If Medium Energy**: Focus on research and documentation
**If Low Energy**: Review the Phase 5 roadmap and plan next week's work

## 📁 Key Files to Reference

- `/Users/myung/.codeium/windsurf-next/brain/06be8719-31b8-4c3d-a1c6-59b861e1ae84/plan.md` - Current Phase 5 plan
- `Windsurf Project Manifest.md` - Project overview and roadmap
- `Windsurf Project Changelog.md` - Recent changes and progress

## 🎯 Success Metric for Tomorrow

**Minimum Viable Progress**: Have a clear understanding of which local AI models to use and their system requirements.

**Stretch Goal**: Have Ollama installed and running a basic inference test.

**Remember**: You've already accomplished the hard part (Git discipline and project organization). Phase 5 is about adding intelligent features to an already solid foundation. Take it one step at a time.

**Have fun at the concert and D&D! 🎸🎲**
