## Thought  
While working on a TDD project that improves my Zettalkasten enviroemnt, I am using automation to clean up my raw notes and improve my personal knowledge management system. 

One of the things I learned from my time 'vibe coding' is the challenge of prompt engineering and context engineering. 

## Context  
Where did this come from? (Article, conversation, reflection, etc.)

## Next Step  
- [ ] Convert to permanent note?
