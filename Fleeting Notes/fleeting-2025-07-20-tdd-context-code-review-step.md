## Thought  
While test‑driven developing automations for my Zettelkasten workflow, I found that scripted cleanup of raw notes sharply improves how quickly I surface relevant ideas. The biggest friction point is crafting prompts and supplying enough context so the AI can classify and refactor notes accurately.

## Insight  
Prompt engineering is only part of the solution. Context engineering—the practice of attaching the right metadata and surrounding information—determines whether the automation adds value or noise.

## Context  
Captured during a coding session while integrating an auto‑classifier script into my personal knowledge management pipeline.

## Next Steps  
- [ ] Draft a permanent note summarizing TDD automation lessons and their impact.  
- [ ] Collect concrete examples of effective context blocks used in prompts.  
- [ ] Add a unit test that flags missing context in incoming notes.  
- [ ] Define metrics to measure the time saved by automated cleanup.
