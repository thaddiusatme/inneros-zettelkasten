## Thought  
Ive considere the idea of going back to the workforce under a corporation. I send about 5-10 applications a week to keep myself open to new opputnities. however, i think its starting to impact me. I might not be approaching the problem of 'freelancing' as deeply as I want. 

how do i address that?

Well i should spend more time on the freelance job boards, improve my content calendar for FB and document more of my journey. i wonder if this is the best approach to go about it. I feel like the thing I am sitting on the most are the things that will propel me forward. 

Finding work is not satisfying and I dont think i am in a position where I can just 'stop'

my partner is feeling the pressure of supporting my wholeheartedly. 


i am wondering if this is the best way forward.
