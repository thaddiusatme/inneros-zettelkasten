# .windsurf Rules Update Recommendations

**Date**: 2025-09-24 15:15 PDT  
**Context**: Post-projects directory cleanup - major reorganization completed  
**Purpose**: Update Windsurf rules to reflect new clean project structure

## üéØ **Critical Updates Needed**

### **1. `.windsurf/rules/session-context.md` Path Updates**

#### **Current Issues:**
- References outdated file paths that are now moved/organized
- Points to deprecated integration analysis files
- Doesn't reflect new ACTIVE/REFERENCE structure

#### **Required Path Updates:**
```markdown
# OLD ‚Üí NEW Path Mappings

# Context-First Development - Required Reads (Priority Order):
1. Projects/inneros-manifest-v3.md ‚Üí Projects/REFERENCE/inneros-manifest-v3.md
2. Projects/project-todo-v3.md ‚Üí Projects/ACTIVE/project-todo-v3.md  
3. Projects/reading-intake-integration-analysis.md ‚Üí Projects/DEPRECATED/reading-intake-integration-analysis.md
4. README.md ‚Üí README.md (unchanged)
5. Projects/windsurf-project-changelog.md ‚Üí Projects/REFERENCE/windsurf-project-changelog.md
```

#### **New Recommended Priority Order:**
```markdown
Required Reads (Priority Order):
1. Projects/REFERENCE/inneros-manifest-v3.md - Comprehensive project overview and architecture
2. Projects/ACTIVE/project-todo-v3.md - Current priorities and next development steps  
3. Projects/ACTIVE/current-priorities-summary.md - 2-week focus areas
4. README.md - Updated project structure and AI features documentation
5. Projects/REFERENCE/windsurf-project-changelog.md - Detailed development history
```

#### **Updated Session Actions:**
```markdown
Session Actions:
- Always ground actions in project context using ACTIVE/ and REFERENCE/ directories
- Check Projects/ACTIVE/ for current priorities before starting development
- Reference completed work in Projects/COMPLETED-2025-XX/ for patterns and lessons
- Consult Projects/DEPRECATED/ only for historical context on superseded approaches
- When in doubt, prioritize ACTIVE manifests over deprecated integration analyses
```

### **2. `.windsurf/rules/file-organization.md` Updates**

#### **Add Projects Directory Organization Section:**
```markdown
## üìÅ Projects Directory Organization (September 2024)

### Structure Overview
```

    ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ *-integration-analysis.md     # Implemented analyses
```

### Organization Rules
- **New Projects**: Start manifests in ACTIVE/, move to DEPRECATED/ when complete
- **Lessons Learned**: Archive immediately to COMPLETED-2025-XX/ by completion month
- **Reference Updates**: Keep REFERENCE/ limited to essential, frequently-accessed docs
- **Monthly Cleanup**: Review ACTIVE/ monthly, archive completed items

### Cognitive Load Management
- **Main Directory**: Keep ‚â§5 files maximum (currently 1 cleanup plan)
- **ACTIVE Focus**: Limit to 8-10 current priority files
- **Archive Discipline**: Move completed work promptly to maintain clarity
- **Deprecation Strategy**: Clear separation between active and historical planning
```

### **3. New Rule: Project Lifecycle Management**

#### **Create: `.windsurf/rules/project-lifecycle.md`**
```markdown
# Project Lifecycle Management Rules

> **Purpose**: Systematic project organization and maintenance  
> **Updated**: 2025-09-24

## üîÑ Project Lifecycle Stages

### **1. Planning ‚Üí ACTIVE/**
- New project manifests start in ACTIVE/
- Include clear success criteria and completion definition
- Reference existing systems for integration opportunities
- Follow TDD iteration planning patterns

### **2. Implementation ‚Üí Development/**
- All code, tests, and technical artifacts in development/
- Maintain connection to ACTIVE/ manifest
- Document lessons learned during implementation
- Follow established TDD methodology patterns

### **3. Completion ‚Üí COMPLETED-2025-XX/**
- Move lessons learned to monthly completion archive
- Archive manifests to DEPRECATED/ if superseded
- Update ACTIVE/project-todo-v3.md to reflect completion
- Maintain references in REFERENCE/ changelog

### **4. Maintenance ‚Üí REFERENCE/**
- Keep essential documentation updated
- Archive outdated versions to DEPRECATED/
- Maintain clear paths to active work
- Ensure documentation reflects current system state

## üìä Organization Maintenance

### **Monthly Review Process:**
1. **Review ACTIVE/**: Identify completed projects
2. **Archive Lessons**: Move to appropriate COMPLETED-2025-XX/
3. **Update References**: Ensure REFERENCE/ reflects current state
4. **Clean Deprecated**: Verify DEPRECATED/ contains only historical context
5. **Update TODO**: Reflect completions in project-todo-v3.md

### **Cognitive Load Targets:**
- **ACTIVE/**: ‚â§10 files (current priority projects)
- **Main Directory**: ‚â§5 files (essential navigation)
- **REFERENCE/**: ‚â§10 files (frequently accessed docs)
- **Archives**: Unlimited (organized by completion date)

## üéØ Integration with AI Workflows

### **TDD Project Patterns:**
- Follow established 4-iteration TDD methodology
- Archive lessons learned immediately upon completion
- Reference previous iterations for acceleration patterns
- Maintain modular utility architecture approaches

### **AI System Integration:**
- New features must leverage existing AI infrastructure
- Preserve backward compatibility with established workflows
- Follow established CLI patterns and user experience design
- Maintain performance targets and test coverage standards

## üìÅ File Movement Guidelines

### **Safe Movement Practices:**
- Always preserve git history when moving files
- Update internal references after file moves
- Maintain backward compatibility where possible
- Document significant organizational changes

### **Validation Checklist:**
- [ ] All ACTIVE/ files represent current priorities
- [ ] REFERENCE/ contains only essential, updated documentation
- [ ] Completed work properly archived by date
- [ ] DEPRECATED/ clearly separated from active planning
- [ ] Main directory maintains minimal cognitive load
```

## üöÄ **Implementation Priority**

### **High Priority Updates:**
1. **session-context.md**: Fix broken file paths immediately
2. **file-organization.md**: Add Projects directory structure section
3. **Create project-lifecycle.md**: New systematic organization rules

### **Medium Priority:**
- Update any remaining references to old project structure in other rule files
- Verify workflow files reflect new organization
- Update any automation scripts that reference old paths

### **Validation Steps:**
1. Search for any remaining references to old file paths
2. Test that all referenced documents exist at new locations  
3. Verify Windsurf can find essential documents for session context
4. Confirm new structure supports established development workflows

## üìä **Expected Benefits**

### **Immediate Impact:**
- **Windsurf Context**: Accurate file paths for session initialization
- **Development Efficiency**: Clear separation of active vs completed work
- **Cognitive Relief**: 97% reduction in project directory clutter maintained

### **Long-term Value:**
- **Scalable Organization**: Monthly archiving prevents future clutter
- **Historical Preservation**: Complete development timeline maintained
- **Pattern Recognition**: TDD lessons properly organized for reference
- **Onboarding Support**: Clear structure for new team members

## üéØ **Action Items**

1. **Update .windsurf/rules/session-context.md** with corrected file paths
2. **Extend .windsurf/rules/file-organization.md** with Projects structure
3. **Create .windsurf/rules/project-lifecycle.md** with maintenance guidelines
4. **Validate all rule references** point to existing files
5. **Test Windsurf session initialization** with updated paths

---

**This update ensures Windsurf rules reflect the dramatically improved project organization while maintaining all established development workflow principles.**
