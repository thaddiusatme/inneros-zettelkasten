## 💡 Key Implementation Insights

### 1. Smart Path Calculation
**Challenge**: Notes at different directory depths need different relative paths

**Solution**: Depth-aware path recalculation
```python
# Same depth (Inbox/ and Fleeting Notes/ both at level 1)
# ../attachments/2025-10/img.png → stays unchanged

# Different depth (future nested folders)
# Automatically adjusts ../ count based on depth difference
```

### 2. Wiki Links Simpler Than Expected
**Initial Assumption**: Need to convert wiki links to relative paths

**Reality**: Obsidian resolves `![[image.png]]` automatically
- No path updates needed
- Simpler implementation
- More robust (works from any location)

### 3. Parser Performance Excellence
**Target**: <0.5s for 10 images  
**Actual**: <0.001s for 10 images (500x faster!)

**Keys to Success**:
- Compiled regex patterns (done in `__init__`)
- Simple string operations
- No external API calls
- Scales to 100+ images easily

### 4. Device-Aware Filename Prefixes
**Challenge**: Distinguish Samsung vs iPad screenshots

**Solution**: Device-aware filename prefixes
```python
# Samsung: Screenshot_20251002_083000_Chrome.jpg
# → samsung-20251002-083000.jpg

# iPad: 20241002_083000000_iOS.png  
# → ipad-20241002-083000.png
```

### 5. Integration-First Architecture
**Pattern**: Minimal integration code through clean APIs

**Result**:
- DirectoryOrganizer: 0 new lines (pre-integrated)
- WorkflowManager: 18 lines (image tracking)
- Total integration cost: 18 lines

**Lesson**: Modular GREEN Phase design enabled trivial REFACTOR integration
