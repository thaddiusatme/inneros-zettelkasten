## 💡 Lessons Learned

### What Worked Well
1. **Post-milestone timing**: Perfect time to clean up
2. **Clear categories**: Easy to decide where files go
3. **README rewrite**: Much clearer than incremental updates
4. **Batch operations**: Faster than one-by-one

### What Could Improve
1. **Automation**: Could script common moves
2. **Templates**: Could use templates for new manifests
3. **Tagging**: Better metadata for auto-categorization
4. **Frequency**: Could clean up more often (monthly?)

### Recommendations
1. **Clean up after each epic**: Don't let files accumulate
2. **Use clear naming**: Makes categorization obvious
3. **Update README immediately**: Don't let it get stale
4. **Document cleanup**: This file helps future cleanups
