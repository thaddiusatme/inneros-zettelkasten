## Decision

We chose **Option 2** because:

1. [Reason 1 - e.g., Best separation of concerns]
2. [Reason 2 - e.g., Minimal impact on existing tests]
3. [Reason 3 - e.g., Aligns with TDD methodology]

## Consequences

### Positive
- [Consequence 1 - e.g., Improved testability]
- [Consequence 2 - e.g., Easier to add features]
- [Consequence 3 - e.g., Better code organization]

### Negative
- [Consequence 1 - e.g., Requires test migration]
- [Consequence 2 - e.g., Temporary complexity during transition]

### Neutral
- [Consequence 1 - e.g., Different file structure]

### Risks
- [Risk 1 - e.g., Test coupling may cause issues]
  - **Mitigation**: [How we'll handle it]
- [Risk 2 - e.g., Performance degradation]
  - **Mitigation**: [How we'll handle it]
