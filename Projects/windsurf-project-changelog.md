## 2025-07-19
### Directory Reorganization (19:53)
- Created new directories: `Inbox`, `People`, and `Media` to improve organization
- Moved timestamped notes (202507191634.md, 202507191758.md) to `Fleeting Notes`
- Moved media files (images, recordings) to the new `Media` directory
- Moved template files to the `Templates` directory
- Moved miscellaneous notes to `Inbox` for future triage
- Created missing notes referenced in Home Note:
  - Weekly review note
  - Three fleeting notes on Zettelkasten entry logic, AI notebook strategy, and Obsidian templates
- Updated Home Note to reflect organizational changes
- Enhanced AHS MOC with proper structure and formatting

### Initial Context & Structure (19:28)
- Created the project manifest to capture context, goals, and the current Zettelkasten + AI workflow.
- Documented the directory structure: `Fleeting Notes`, `Permanent Notes`, `Templates`, and supporting folders.
- Confirmed use of Templater scripts for file creation, movement, and metadata insertion.
- Standardized note types: Fleeting, Permanent, Literature, Reference/MOC.
- Metadata fields in use: `Type`, `Created`, `Tags`, and (proposed) `visibility`.
- Promotion flow: Fleeting → Permanent Notes with manual and (future) LLM-assisted triage.
- Privacy and multi-user support flagged as essential for all future development.

### Current State
- No destructive changes made; all notes preserved.
- No existing automation scripts for LLM integration yet—schema and workflow improvements are next.
- YAML/markdown metadata is present in templates and most notes; standardization is ongoing.
- AI/LLM integration points and privacy fields proposed in the manifest, not yet implemented.
