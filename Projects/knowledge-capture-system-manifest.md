## üéØ Project Overview

### **Vision**
Transform mobile screenshots and voice notes into connected knowledge within a Zettelkasten system, eliminating "capture graveyards" and accelerating content creation workflow.

### **Core Problem**
- **50+ screenshots weekly** accumulate across mobile/desktop without processing
- **Valuable insights lost** in device folders and cloud storage
- **No connection** between visual captures and existing knowledge base  
- **Mobile capture 90%** of workflow but zero processing capability
- **Screenshots + voice context** often captured together but never paired

### **Success Metric**
Screenshots no longer accumulate unprocessed; captured insights integrate seamlessly into content creation workflow with 80% processing rate within one week.
