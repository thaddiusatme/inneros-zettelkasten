# 🔗 Smart Link Management System - TDD Project Plan

**Project**: Automated Link Suggestion & Management for InnerOS Zettelkasten  
**Priority**: P1 (High Impact User Experience Enhancement)  
**Estimated Duration**: 3-4 TDD iterations  
**Dependencies**: Connection Discovery System ✅ (Complete)

---

## 🎯 Project Vision

Transform the **Connection Discovery System** from a **discovery-only** tool into a **complete link management workflow** that helps users efficiently create, manage, and maintain semantic connections in their Zettelkasten.

### **Core Problem Statement**
- Users get **connection suggestions** but must manually review and add `[[links]]`
- **No guidance** on which connections are worth linking
- **No streamlined workflow** for batch link management  
- **Missing bidirectional link management**
- **No quality assessment** of suggested connections

---

## 🏗️ Feature Requirements

### **US-1: Interactive Link Suggestions** (P0)
**As a** knowledge worker  
**I want** AI to suggest specific `[[link text]]` for discovered connections  
**So that** I can quickly review and add relevant links without manual formatting

**Acceptance Criteria:**
- Display discovered connections with **suggested link text**
- Show **confidence scores** and **relevance explanations**
- Allow **one-click acceptance** or **rejection** of suggestions
- Support **batch processing** of multiple suggestions

### **US-2: Smart Link Insertion** (P0)
**As a** user reviewing link suggestions  
**I want** to add selected links directly to my notes  
**So that** I don't have to manually edit files and format `[[brackets]]`

**Acceptance Criteria:**
- **Auto-insert** `[[links]]` at appropriate locations in target notes
- **Preserve existing formatting** and note structure
- **Create backups** before making changes
- Support **undo/rollback** functionality

### **US-3: Bidirectional Link Management** (P1)
**As a** Zettelkasten user  
**I want** bidirectional connections automatically managed  
**So that** my knowledge graph is complete and navigable in both directions

**Acceptance Criteria:**
- **Detect missing backlinks** in connected notes
- **Suggest bidirectional connections** where appropriate
- **Maintain link consistency** across note moves/renames
- **Visual indicators** for one-way vs. bidirectional links

### **US-4: Link Quality Assessment** (P1)
**As a** user managing many connections  
**I want** quality scores for suggested links  
**So that** I can prioritize the most valuable connections

**Acceptance Criteria:**
- **Quality scoring algorithm** based on semantic similarity + context relevance
- **Priority ranking** of suggestions (High/Medium/Low)
- **Explanation** of why each link is suggested
- **Learning from user feedback** to improve future suggestions

### **US-5: Batch Link Management Dashboard** (P2)
**As a** user with many notes  
**I want** a dashboard to manage links across my entire vault  
**So that** I can maintain my knowledge graph efficiently

**Acceptance Criteria:**
- **Overview** of all suggested connections
- **Bulk approval/rejection** workflows
- **Link health monitoring** (broken links, orphaned notes)
- **Progress tracking** for link management sessions
