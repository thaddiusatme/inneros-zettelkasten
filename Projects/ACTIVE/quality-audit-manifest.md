# Quality Audit & Workflow Validation Manifest

**Created**: 2025-10-10  
**Status**: üöÄ **ACTIVE** - Phase 1: Comprehensive Audit  
**Priority**: P0 - Foundation for TUI Development  
**Timeline**: 3-5 days

---

## üéØ Vision

**Goal**: Ensure all existing workflows achieve expected results reliably before building unified TUI.

**Philosophy**: Can't build a good interface for broken workflows. Audit ‚Üí Fix ‚Üí Polish ‚Üí Build UI.

**Success**: Confidence that every workflow works as intended with clear error messages and recovery paths.

- [ ] Verify quality scores are realistic
- [ ] Check promotion recommendations make sense
- [ ] Test with empty directory (edge case)
- [ ] Test with malformed YAML (error handling)
- [ ] Measure actual performance

**Issues to Check**:
- Does it find all eligible notes?
- Are quality scores accurate?

## üîß Audit Methodology

### **Phase 1: Discovery** (Day 1)

**Run each workflow manually**:
```bash
# Weekly Review
python3 development/src/cli/workflow_demo.py knowledge/ --weekly-review

# Connection Discovery
python3 development/src/cli/connections_demo.py knowledge/

# YouTube Processing
python3 development/src/cli/youtube_cli.py process <video-url>

# Tag Enhancement
python3 development/src/cli/workflow_demo.py knowledge/ --enhance-tags

# Analytics
python3 development/src/cli/workflow_demo.py knowledge/ --analytics
```

**Document**:
- ‚úÖ What works
- ‚ùå What fails
- ‚ö†Ô∏è What's confusing
- üí° What could be better

---

### **Phase 2: Testing** (Day 2-3)

**For each workflow**:
1. **Happy path**: Normal usage with good data
2. **Edge cases**: Empty input, malformed data, missing files
3. **Error handling**: Invalid input, network failures, disk full
4. **Performance**: Measure actual execution time
5. **User experience**: Is output clear? Are errors helpful?

**Create test matrix**:
```
| Workflow         | Works? | Errors Clear? | Fast Enough? | Notes |
|------------------|--------|---------------|--------------|-------|
| Weekly Review    | ‚úÖ     | ‚úÖ            | ‚úÖ           |       |
| YouTube Process  | ‚ö†Ô∏è     | ‚ùå            | ‚úÖ           | URL validation unclear |
| Connections      | ‚úÖ     | ‚úÖ            | ‚ö†Ô∏è           | Slow on 200+ notes |
```
