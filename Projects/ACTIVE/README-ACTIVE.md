## 🎯 Next Priority Options

**Ordered by impact (user feedback-driven)**:

### ✅ Priority 1: 🔍 Automation Visibility CLI - **COMPLETE** ✅
**Status**: ✅ PRODUCTION READY - TDD Iteration 1 Complete  
**Branch**: `feat/automation-visibility-cli-tdd-iteration-1`  
**Commits**: `df51a20` + `d5cad2f`

**Achievement**: Addressed #1 user pain point
> "Not a lot of visibility into what I am doing"
> "Automations are scary/friction to run"

**Delivered**:
- ✅ AutomationStatusCLI with daemon detection (psutil-based, cross-platform)
- ✅ Log parsing with last-run details (timestamp, success/failure, duration, errors)
- ✅ Daemon registry system (.automation/config/daemon_registry.yaml)
- ✅ AI context integration (daemon registry now CRITICAL priority in .windsurf/rules/)
- ✅ 18/18 tests passing (100% success)
- ✅ Performance: <0.05s (100x better than requirement)
- ✅ 3 comprehensive guides (MAINTENANCE, QUICK-ADD, lessons learned)

**Features Implemented**:
```python
status()      # Check all daemon statuses (🟢 running / 🔴 stopped)
last_run()    # Last execution details for specific daemon
logs()        # Display last N lines from daemon logs
```

**Impact**: Complete visibility into 3 production daemons, zero-friction status checks

**Next**: Integration with main `./inneros` CLI wrapper (P1)

---

### Priority 2: 🔧 Note Lifecycle Status Management (P0, 2-3 hours)
**Status**: Partially complete, 3 PBIs remaining  
**Value**: Complete workflow automation for note promotion  

**Remaining Work**:
1. **PBI-002**: Literature directory integration (30 min)
2. **PBI-003**: Repair 77 orphaned notes (60 min)
3. **PBI-004**: Safe file moves to correct directories (30 min)

**Impact**: 
- **Before**: 77 notes stuck in Inbox/ indefinitely
- **After**: Clean workflow, auto-promotion working end-to-end

---

### Priority 3: 🌿 Git Branch Cleanup (P1, 2-3 hours)
**Status**: Critical technical debt  
**Value**: Reduce cognitive overhead  

**Problem**: 70+ unmerged feature branches
- Unclear completion/merge status
- Context switching overhead
- Risk of duplicate work

**Strategy**:
1. Categorize branches (merged/ready/in-progress/abandoned)
2. Review priority branches (housekeeping/*, feat/*)
3. Create branch management process
4. Auto-flag stale branches (GitHub workflow)

**Target**: Reduce to <20 active branches

---

### Priority 4: 🎬 YouTube CLI Improvements (P1, 1-2 hours)
**Status**: User uses often, wants improvements  
**Value**: Enhance frequently-used workflow  

**Action**: Get specific user feedback
- Too slow?
- Missing features?
- Hard to use?

**Solution**: TBD based on feedback

---

### Priority 5: 🏗️ WorkflowManager Decomposition (P1, Nov 2025)
**Status**: Planned for post-sprint  
**Value**: Continue architectural improvements  

**Target Extractions**:
- ConnectionManager (~300 LOC)
- AnalyticsCoordinator (~400 LOC)
- PromotionEngine (~200 LOC)

**Current**: 2,420 LOC god class  
**Timeline**: End of November 2025 (3-4 sprints)
