## üéØ Next Priority Options

**Ordered by impact (user feedback-driven)**:

### Priority 1: üîç Automation Visibility CLI (P0, 1-2 hours) ‚≠ê **HIGHEST IMPACT**
**Status**: Project plan ready, TDD iteration prepared  
**Value**: Remove fear and increase confidence in automation  
**Branch**: `feat/automation-visibility-cli-tdd-iteration-1`

**User Pain Point** (Direct Quote):
> "Not a lot of visibility into what I am doing"
> "Automations are scary/friction to run"

**Problem**: Sophisticated automation with ZERO visibility
- ‚ùå Can't tell if daemons are running
- ‚ùå Don't know when automation last ran
- ‚ùå No way to check logs quickly
- ‚ùå Fear of breaking things prevents usage

**Solution**: Create `automation_status_cli.py`
```bash
./inneros automation status    # Are daemons running?
./inneros automation last-run  # What happened?
./inneros automation logs      # Show recent logs
./inneros automation start     # Easy startup
./inneros automation stop      # Easy shutdown
```

**Impact**: User reports reduced anxiety, increased daily usage

**Why P0**: #1 user pain point, enables all other automation

---

### Priority 2: üîß Note Lifecycle Status Management (P0, 2-3 hours)
**Status**: Partially complete, 3 PBIs remaining  
**Value**: Complete workflow automation for note promotion  

**Remaining Work**:
1. **PBI-002**: Literature directory integration (30 min)
2. **PBI-003**: Repair 77 orphaned notes (60 min)
3. **PBI-004**: Safe file moves to correct directories (30 min)

**Impact**: 
- **Before**: 77 notes stuck in Inbox/ indefinitely
- **After**: Clean workflow, auto-promotion working end-to-end

---

### Priority 3: üåø Git Branch Cleanup (P1, 2-3 hours)
**Status**: Critical technical debt  
**Value**: Reduce cognitive overhead  

**Problem**: 70+ unmerged feature branches
- Unclear completion/merge status
- Context switching overhead
- Risk of duplicate work

**Strategy**:
1. Categorize branches (merged/ready/in-progress/abandoned)
2. Review priority branches (housekeeping/*, feat/*)
3. Create branch management process
4. Auto-flag stale branches (GitHub workflow)

**Target**: Reduce to <20 active branches

---

### Priority 4: üé¨ YouTube CLI Improvements (P1, 1-2 hours)
**Status**: User uses often, wants improvements  
**Value**: Enhance frequently-used workflow  

**Action**: Get specific user feedback
- Too slow?
- Missing features?
- Hard to use?

**Solution**: TBD based on feedback

---

### Priority 5: üèóÔ∏è WorkflowManager Decomposition (P1, Nov 2025)
**Status**: Planned for post-sprint  
**Value**: Continue architectural improvements  

**Target Extractions**:
- ConnectionManager (~300 LOC)
- AnalyticsCoordinator (~400 LOC)
- PromotionEngine (~200 LOC)

**Current**: 2,420 LOC god class  
**Timeline**: End of November 2025 (3-4 sprints)

## üéØ Next Actions

### **Immediate** - START THIS ‚≠ê
**Automation Visibility CLI** - TDD Iteration 1

**Why P0** (User Feedback):
- #1 user pain point: "Not a lot of visibility"
- Blocks automation adoption: "Automations are scary"
- Quick win: 1-2 hours for core features
- Enables confidence in all automation

**Quick Win**: In 1-2 hours you'll have:
```bash
./inneros automation status    # See what's running
./inneros automation last-run  # See what happened
./inneros automation logs      # Debug issues
```

**Branch**: `feat/automation-visibility-cli-tdd-iteration-1`

**TDD Plan**:
- RED: Daemon detection, log parsing tests
- GREEN: Minimal AutomationStatusCLI class
- REFACTOR: Extract utility classes (DaemonDetector, LogParser)

### **Alternative Options** (Lower Priority)
1. **Note Lifecycle PBIs** - Complete remaining 3 tasks (2-3 hours)
2. **Git Branch Cleanup** - Reduce 70+ branches to <20 (2-3 hours)
3. **YouTube Improvements** - Get user feedback, enhance workflow
4. **WorkflowManager Decomposition** - Begin gradual refactor (Nov 2025)

### **After Next Feature**
1. User testing session - validate automation visibility
2. Update project-todo-v4.md with completion status
3. Continue P0 priorities from user feedback
