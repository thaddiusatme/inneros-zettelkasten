## Canonical docs (start here)

- `Projects/ACTIVE/PROJECT-MANIFEST.md` (canonical current state + roadmap)
- `Projects/ACTIVE/SPRINT-MAKE-IT-USABLE.md` (execution plan)
- `Projects/ACTIVE/DISCOVERY-AUDIT.md` (what works / what’s broken)
- `Projects/ACTIVE/PROJECT-INTAKE.md` (repo map + constraints)
- `Projects/ACTIVE/obsidian-shell-commands-inneros-integration-notes-2025-12-25.md` (Obsidian Shell Commands integration: core `process-note` + conditional YouTube transcript/quotes + debugging notes)

## File organization rule

Keep `Projects/ACTIVE/` small and high-signal.

- Current sprint/epic planning only.
- Move lessons learned and completed manifests to `Projects/COMPLETED-YYYY-MM/`.
- Move older/superseded planning to `Projects/Archive/` or `Projects/REFERENCE/`.
