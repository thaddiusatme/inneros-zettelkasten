# ADR-003: WorkflowManager Size Limit Exception

**Date**: October 16, 2025  
**Status**: ✅ **APPROVED EXCEPTION** with monitoring plan  
**Context**: Phase 3.1 metrics integration completion

---

## Decision

**Grant temporary exception** for WorkflowManager to exceed 500 LOC hard limit.

**Current State**: 887 LOC, 32 methods  
**Target State**: <500 LOC within 2 sprints  
**Exception Valid Until**: December 15, 2025

---

## Context

### Why Exception is Needed

WorkflowManager currently serves as a **Composition Root** (Dependency Injection pattern):
- Initializes 13 specialized coordinators
- Each coordinator requires 3-8 lines of initialization code
- Pure delegation layer with minimal business logic
- No god class symptoms (see analysis below)

### ADR-001/002 Compliance Analysis

**✅ Good Architectural Properties**:
- Single Responsibility: Coordinator aggregation and lifecycle management
- No complex business logic (delegated to coordinators)
- Clean delegation pattern (1-line method calls)
- 13 coordinators managing 4,250+ LOC of actual logic
- 72/72 tests passing

**⚠️ Size Metrics**:
- **LOC**: 887 (exceeds 500 hard limit by 387 lines)
- **Methods**: 32 (exceeds 20 hard limit by 12 methods)
- **Imports**: 30+ coordinator/utility imports

**❌ Why Still Too Large**:
- Coordinator initialization boilerplate (13 coordinators × ~7 lines = 91 LOC)
- Utility class initialization (6 utilities × ~5 lines = 30 LOC)
- Directory path configuration (~20 LOC)
- Import statements (~30 LOC)
- Docstrings and comments (~50 LOC)

---

## Root Cause Analysis

### Not a God Class

WorkflowManager is NOT exhibiting god class anti-patterns:
- ✅ No complex algorithms or business logic
- ✅ No multiple unrelated responsibilities
- ✅ Clean delegation to specialized coordinators
- ✅ Easy to explain: "Aggregates and coordinates workflow operations"
- ✅ Changes are localized to coordinators, not WorkflowManager

### Actual Problem

WorkflowManager is a **Composition Root** pattern victim:
- Must initialize many dependencies
- Dependencies have complex constructor signatures
- Each coordinator needs 5-8 initialization lines
- Python requires explicit initialization (unlike IoC containers)

---

## Solution Strategy

### Phase 13b: Extract WorkflowManagerBuilder (Priority P2)

**Timeline**: Within 2 sprints (by Dec 15, 2025)

```python
# NEW: src/ai/workflow_manager_builder.py (EstimatedLOC: 300)
class WorkflowManagerBuilder:
    """
    Builder pattern for WorkflowManager initialization.
    Extracts coordinator construction complexity.
    """
    
    def __init__(self, base_directory: str):
        self.base_directory = base_directory
        self.coordinators = {}
        self.utilities = {}
    
    def build_coordinators(self) -> Dict[str, Any]:
        """Build all 13 coordinators with proper dependencies."""
        # Extract 200+ LOC of initialization code
        ...
    
    def build_utilities(self) -> Dict[str, Any]:
        """Build all utility classes."""
        # Extract 50+ LOC of utility initialization
        ...
    
    def build(self) -> 'WorkflowManager':
        """Construct complete WorkflowManager."""
        return WorkflowManager(
            coordinators=self.coordinators,
            utilities=self.utilities
        )
```

**Result**: WorkflowManager → ~400 LOC (under 500 LOC limit)

---

## Alternative Considered: Dependency Injection Container

**Option**: Use Python DI framework (e.g., `dependency-injector`, `pinject`)

**Pros**:
- Automatic dependency resolution
- Cleaner initialization code
- Industry standard pattern

**Cons**:
- External dependency for core system
- Additional learning curve
- Magic behavior (harder to debug)
- Overkill for 13 coordinators

**Decision**: Rejected in favor of explicit WorkflowManagerBuilder pattern

---

## Monitoring Plan

### Monthly Check-In (First Monday)

1. **Measure WorkflowManager size**:
   ```bash
   wc -l development/src/ai/workflow_manager.py
   ```

2. **Track coordinator count**:
   ```bash
   grep -c "Coordinator(" development/src/ai/workflow_manager.py
   ```

3. **Verify no new business logic added**:
   - All new features → coordinators
   - WorkflowManager → delegation only

### Triggers for Immediate Refactor

**MUST refactor immediately if ANY are true**:
- [ ] WorkflowManager >1000 LOC
- [ ] New business logic added to WorkflowManager
- [ ] Method with >10 lines of non-initialization code
- [ ] God class symptoms emerge (multiple responsibilities)

---

## Success Criteria for Exception Removal

**Exception can be removed when**:
1. ✅ WorkflowManagerBuilder extracted
2. ✅ WorkflowManager <500 LOC
3. ✅ WorkflowManager <20 methods
4. ✅ All 72+ tests still passing
5. ✅ Zero regression in functionality

**Target Date**: December 15, 2025
