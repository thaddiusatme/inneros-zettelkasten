# InnerOS Zettelkasten - Project Todo v5.0

**Last Updated**: 2025-10-29 08:20 PDT
**Status**: üü° **CI/CD INFRASTRUCTURE ISSUES** - Quality gates working, but billing/deployment strategy needs resolution
**Scope**: Entire InnerOS (Solopreneur Edition)
**Previous Version**: `project-todo-v4.md` (619 lines archived)

---

## üéØ Product Vision (Unchanged)

**Core Purpose**: Personal knowledge management tool for a solo developer power user

- CLI-first, local files, safety-first automation
- Teachable and shippable: clear docs, one-command dev, small but real tests
- Closed beta for a few power users without breakage or data loss

---

## üèóÔ∏è Architectural Health

**Status**: ‚úÖ Improving ‚Äî hygiene bundle applied, CI aligned to Makefile, daemon registry corrected

### Stable

- Safety/backup workflows
- Weekly review analytics
- CI-Lite pattern (ruff/black/pyright/pytest via `make test`)

### In-Flux / Next Refactors

- `WorkflowManager` decomposition (ConnectionManager, AnalyticsCoordinator, PromotionEngine)
- Web UI scope and feature flags

## ‚úÖ Recently Completed (Oct 26-29, 2025)

### Oct 28-29: CI/CD Infrastructure & Dual-Repo Sync

**Duration**: ~3 hours across 2 sessions

**Deliverables**:

- ‚úÖ **Ubuntu CI Switch** (Oct 27): Switched from macOS to Ubuntu runners (conserve free tier: 10x cheaper)
- ‚úÖ **CI Quality Gates** (Oct 27): PR #7 merged - lint, format, type checking in `.github/workflows/ci.yml`
- ‚úÖ **Test Collection Fixes** (Oct 27): Fixed psutil import, 1872 tests now discoverable (was 1788)
- ‚úÖ **Dual-Repo Sync** (Oct 28): `scripts/sync-repos.sh` + git alias `sync-all`
  - Private: `thaddiusatme/inneros-zettelkasten` (billing limits: 2000 min/month Ubuntu)
  - Public: `thaddiusatme/inneros-zettelkasten-public` (unlimited CI/CD)
- ‚úÖ **TDD Workflow v4.0** (Oct 28): Updated `.windsurf/workflows/tdd-git-workflow.md` with CI/CD automation docs
- ‚úÖ **Markdown Linting** (Oct 28): Fixed 30+ MD022/MD032 violations across workflows

**Impact**: CI/CD infrastructure functional, dual-repo strategy in place, documentation updated

### Oct 26: Repo Hygiene Bundle

- Makefile (`test`, `cov`, `run`, `ui`)
- CI-Lite calls `make test`
- Daemon registry path fixes (3/3 daemons)
- .gitignore tightened (`.automation/metrics/`, cache|logs|tmp, `reports/`)
- Docs skeleton: ARCHITECTURE, HOWTOs (weekly review, inbox)
- ADRs: 0001 provider policy (local-first), 0002 prompt storage (draft)
- Observability HOWTOs: daemon health (uses AutomationStatusCLI), metrics export (`/api/metrics`)
- Intake persisted: `Projects/ACTIVE/PROJECT-INTAKE.md` (13-point, full InnerOS)

**Impact**: One-command dev, cleaner CI, safer automation visibility, repeatable setup

**See**: `Projects/COMPLETED-2025-10/` for detailed completion docs (180+ files)

## üî¥ P0: CI/CD Infrastructure Resolution (This Week)

**Status**: üü° **BLOCKED** - Dual-repo strategy in place, but not yet operational

### Current State

- ‚úÖ Private repo: CI working with Ubuntu runners (2000 min/month limit)
- ‚úÖ Public repo: Synced via `scripts/sync-repos.sh`
- ‚ùå Public repo: CI/CD **NOT configured** (no workflows pushed)
- ‚ùå Deployment strategy: Unclear

### Issues to Resolve

**1. GitHub Actions Billing Constraints** üî¥

- Private repo limited to 2,000 Ubuntu minutes/month
- Already using Ubuntu (10x cheaper than macOS)
- Risk: Hitting limits with PR-based development

**2. Public Repo CI/CD Not Configured** üü°

- Public repo has unlimited CI/CD minutes
- Workflows exist in private repo but not synced to public
- Need to decide: Mirror all workflows? Subset?

**3. Deployment Strategy Undefined** üü°

- Where should PRs be opened? Private? Public? Both?
- Which repo should run expensive CI jobs (coverage, CodeQL)?
- How to handle security scanning on public repo?

### Options

#### Option A: Primary Development on Public Repo (Recommended)

- Move all development to public repo
- Unlimited CI/CD minutes
- Great for portfolio
- Private repo becomes backup/personal notes
- **Action**: Copy all workflows to public, update README, switch development

#### Option B: Dual-PR Workflow

- Open PRs on both repos
- Light CI on private (lint/format only)
- Full CI on public (tests, coverage, security)
- **Action**: Configure public repo workflows, update CONTRIBUTING.md

#### Option C: Stay Private + Add Payment

- Add credit card to GitHub account
- Set spending limit (e.g., $5/month)
- Continue as-is
- **Action**: Update billing settings

### Immediate Tasks (Choose Option First)

- [ ] **DECISION**: Choose Option A, B, or C
- [ ] Update `.github/workflows/` in chosen repo(s)
- [ ] Configure branch protection rules
- [ ] Update CONTRIBUTING.md with CI/CD workflow
- [ ] Test PR workflow end-to-end

**Blocked Until**: CI/CD strategy decision made
