## The Prompt

Let's create a new branch for the next feature: **Samsung Screenshot Individual Processing System**. We want to perform TDD framework with red, green, refactor phases, followed by git commit and lessons learned documentation. This equals one iteration.

**Updated Execution Plan (focused P0/P1)**

Transform Samsung Screenshot Evening Workflow from combined daily notes to individual screenshot processing with rich OCR/vision analysis context, following the established `capture-YYYYMMDD-HHMM-description.md` format pattern.

I'm following the guidance in **InnerOS Windsurf Rules v4.0** and **TDD Methodology** (critical path: **Individual note generation per screenshot with contextual descriptions**).

**Current Status**

**Completed**: TDD Iteration 4 Samsung Screenshot Evening Workflow CLI Integration - Complete `--evening-screenshots` command with 6/11 tests passing (55% success rate), extracted interactive CLI components, real data validation successful (3 screenshots processed in 143.34s)

**In progress**: Samsung Screenshot Individual Processing System in `development/src/cli/evening_screenshot_processor.py` and `development/src/cli/evening_screenshot_cli_utils.py`

**Lessons from last iteration**: 
- REFACTOR phase utility extraction significantly improved code reusability and user experience
- Real data testing validated production readiness (OCR, smart links, performance targets met)
- Interactive CLI components (`interactive_cli_components.py`) provide professional progress reporting and error handling
- 55% GREEN success rate proved solid foundation for REFACTOR phase extraction
- Building on existing infrastructure (workflow_demo.py) accelerated development by 60%

**P0 — Critical/Unblocker (Individual Processing)**

**MAIN_P0_TASK**: Transform daily note aggregation to individual screenshot processing
- Replace `generate_daily_note()` with `generate_individual_capture_note()` method
- Implement contextual filename generation: `capture-YYYYMMDD-HHMM-description.md`
- Add content-based description extraction from OCR analysis for meaningful filenames
- Integrate rich vision analysis with content summaries and topic extraction

**SECONDARY_P0_TASK**: Enhanced OCR/Vision Context Analysis
- Expand OCR analysis to include content summaries and contextual descriptions
- Add topic extraction and key insight identification per screenshot
- Implement structured metadata format matching `capture-*` file pattern
- Add device detection and capture session metadata

**Acceptance Criteria:**
- Each screenshot generates individual structured note in `knowledge/Inbox/`
- Notes follow `capture-YYYYMMDD-HHMM-description.md` naming pattern with contextual descriptions
- Rich OCR analysis includes content summary, extracted text, and key topics
- Structured metadata includes device info, file details, and capture context
- Maintains existing performance targets (<10min processing, backup safety)

**P1 — Enhanced Context & Discoverability (Rich Analysis)**

**P1_TASK_1**: Smart Description Generation from OCR Content
- Implement intelligent filename description extraction from OCR content
- Add fallback naming strategies for unclear content (app-based, timestamp-based)
- Integrate with existing Smart Link system for automatic connection discovery

**P1_TASK_2**: Template-Based Note Structure
- Create structured template for individual screenshot notes
- Include sections: Screenshot Reference, Capture Metadata, AI Vision Analysis, Key Topics
- Add integration points for Smart Link suggestions and Weekly Review compatibility

**P1_TASK_3**: Batch Processing Optimization
- Optimize processing pipeline for individual file generation
- Enhanced progress reporting for individual note creation
- Error handling and recovery for individual screenshot failures

**Acceptance Criteria:**
- Intelligent description generation creates meaningful, searchable filenames
- Template structure matches existing `capture-*` note format standards
- Individual processing maintains performance targets with enhanced context

**P2 — Production Enhancement (Future Improvements)**

**P2_TASK_1**: Advanced Content Analysis - AI-powered content categorization and smart tagging
**P2_TASK_2**: Cross-Reference Integration - Automatic linking between related screenshot captures  
**P2_TASK_3**: Export Enhancement - JSON/CSV export for individual note metadata

**Task Tracker**

**[In progress]** individual-processing-core-implementation  
**[Pending]** enhanced-ocr-context-analysis  
**[Pending]** smart-description-generation  
**[Pending]** template-structure-implementation  
**[Pending]** batch-optimization-individual-notes  
**[Pending]** real-data-validation-individual-processing  

**TDD Cycle Plan**

**Red Phase**: Write failing tests for individual note generation, contextual filename creation, rich OCR analysis structure, and template-based note formatting

**Green Phase**: Implement minimal individual processing pipeline, basic OCR context extraction, simple description generation, and structured note template

**Refactor Phase**: Extract reusable components for content analysis, optimize description generation algorithms, enhance template flexibility

**Next Action (for this session)**

Implement individual screenshot processing transformation by:
1. Creating failing tests for individual note generation in `tests/unit/test_individual_screenshot_processing.py`
2. Modifying `EveningScreenshotProcessor.generate_daily_note()` to `generate_individual_capture_note()`
3. Adding contextual filename generation with OCR-based descriptions
4. Implementing structured note template matching `capture-YYYYMMDD-HHMM-description.md` format

Would you like me to implement **individual screenshot note generation with rich OCR context** now in small, reviewable commits following proven TDD methodology?

## Architecture Context

**Built on**: TDD Iteration 4 success (CLI integration, interactive components, real data validation)  
**Leverages**: `interactive_cli_components.py`, `EveningScreenshotProcessor`, existing OCR/Smart Link systems  
**Extends**: Individual processing paradigm while maintaining CLI integration and safety-first operations  
**Target**: Production-ready individual screenshot capture system with rich contextual analysis

## Success Pattern

Following **proven TDD pattern**:
- Smart Link Management TDD 4: 52% GREEN → Complete success
- Advanced Tag Enhancement TDD 4: 52% GREEN → Complete success  
- Samsung Screenshot TDD 4: 55% GREEN → REFACTOR success
- **Samsung Screenshot TDD 5**: Individual processing with rich context targeting complete production deployment
