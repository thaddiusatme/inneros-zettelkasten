## 🧪 Bug Reproduction Strategy

### **Phase 1: Controlled Symptom Recreation**

#### **Test Scenario A: Screenshot Processing Chain**
```
SETUP: Fresh Samsung S23 screenshot with LLaVA OCR processing
├── Baseline: Verify image exists and accessible
├── Trigger: Run AI enhancement workflow
├── Monitor: Track image file throughout process
└── Validate: Confirm image preservation post-processing
```

#### **Test Scenario B: Note Promotion Workflow**
```
SETUP: Fleeting note with embedded image in Inbox/
├── Baseline: Document image path and file integrity
├── Trigger: Promote note from fleeting → permanent
├── Monitor: Track image during status transitions
└── Validate: Image accessibility in promoted note
```

#### **Test Scenario C: Template Processing System**
```
SETUP: Note with image using template system
├── Baseline: Image embedded in template-generated content
├── Trigger: Template processing with AI integration
├── Monitor: Image handling during template execution
└── Validate: Image preservation in final output
```

### **Phase 2: AI Workflow Integration Points**

#### **Risk Areas Identified**
1. **AI Enhancement Pipeline** (`development/src/ai/workflow_manager.py`)
2. **Note Promotion System** (fleeting → permanent transitions)
3. **Template Processing** (`knowledge/Templates/` + Templater scripts)
4. **Batch Processing** (multiple note AI processing)
5. **Connection Discovery** (when building link relationships)

## 🔍 Technical Investigation Plan

### **Diagnostic Tools & Monitoring**

#### **Image Integrity Checker**
```python
class ImageIntegrityMonitor:
    """Monitor image files throughout AI processing workflows"""
    
    def __init__(self, vault_path: str):
        self.vault_path = Path(vault_path)
        self.tracked_images = {}
        
    def register_image(self, image_path: Path, context: str):
        """Register image for monitoring"""
        
    def verify_image_exists(self, image_path: Path) -> bool:
        """Check if image file still exists"""
        
    def track_workflow_step(self, step_name: str, images: List[Path]):
        """Monitor images during workflow step"""
        
    def generate_audit_report(self) -> Dict:
        """Generate complete audit trail"""
```

#### **Workflow Checkpoints**
- **Pre-AI Processing**: Image inventory and verification
- **During AI Processing**: File system monitoring hooks
- **Post-AI Processing**: Image integrity validation
- **Error Recovery**: Backup restoration procedures

### **Test Data Preparation**

#### **Controlled Test Images**
1. **Screenshot Samples**: 5 Samsung S23 screenshots with different content types
2. **Embedded Images**: Notes with `![[image.png]]` markdown syntax
3. **Reference Images**: External image links and attachments
4. **Mixed Content**: Notes with multiple image types and formats

#### **Backup Safety System**
```
test-images/
├── originals/           # Pristine test image copies
├── checksums.md5        # File integrity verification
├── metadata.json       # Image tracking metadata
└── recovery-scripts/    # Automated restoration tools
```

## 🛠️ Technical Implementation Plan

### **TDD Methodology: RED → GREEN → REFACTOR**

#### **RED Phase: Reproduce the Bug**
1. **Create failing tests** that demonstrate image loss
2. **Document exact conditions** where images disappear
3. **Identify workflow points** where integrity fails
4. **Establish baseline metrics** for image preservation

#### **GREEN Phase: Fix Implementation**
1. **Image preservation system** during AI processing
2. **Atomic file operations** with rollback capability
3. **Workflow safety checks** at each processing step
4. **Error handling** with automatic recovery

1. **Comprehensive audit trail** for all image operations
2. **Performance optimization** without sacrificing safety
3. **Integration testing** across all AI workflows
4. **Documentation updates** for maintenance

### **Core Fixes Architecture**

#### **Safe Image Processing Pipeline**
```python
class SafeImageProcessor:
    """AI-safe image processing with preservation guarantees"""
    
    def __init__(self):
        self.backup_manager = ImageBackupManager()
        self.integrity_checker = ImageIntegrityMonitor()
        
    def process_note_with_images(self, note_path: Path) -> ProcessingResult:
        """Process note while preserving all images"""
        
        # 1. Pre-processing: Inventory and backup images
        images = self.extract_image_references(note_path)
        backup_session = self.backup_manager.create_session(images)
        
        try:
            # 2. Processing: Monitor throughout workflow
            self.integrity_checker.start_monitoring(images)
            result = self.run_ai_workflow(note_path)
            
            # 3. Post-processing: Validate preservation
            if self.integrity_checker.validate_all_images():
                backup_session.commit()
                return result
            else:
                raise ImageIntegrityError("Images lost during processing")
                
        except Exception as e:
            # 4. Recovery: Restore from backup
            backup_session.rollback()
            raise ProcessingError(f"AI processing failed: {e}")
```
