# Knowledge Base Cleanup Inventory — TDD Iteration 2 Lessons Learned

## Iteration Overview

- **Feature**: Automation asset routing + metadata surfaced in cleanup inventory
- **Branch Plan**: `housekeeping/cleanup-inventory-cli`
- **TDD Cycle**: `test_cleanup_inventory.py` → `cleanup_inventory.py` → metadata helpers + doc updates
- **Test Command**: `PYTHONPATH=development pytest development/tests/unit/automation/test_cleanup_inventory.py`

## What Worked Well

- RED test targeting `.automation/scripts/audit_design_flaws.sh` kept the scope tied to tangible automation assets.
- GREEN implementation extended `_build_record` minimally while preserving earlier documentation routing guarantees.
- Sorting metadata output and extracting `_automation_metadata()` helper made the YAML deterministic for future assertions.

## Challenges & Decisions

- Needed to codify default trigger/monitor constants so future CLI flags can override consistently.
- Re-reviewing automation-monitoring requirements surfaced the need to capture monitoring destinations alongside triggers.

## Next Steps

1. Extend RED coverage for daemon/cron variants (event-driven watcher scripts, health monitors).
2. Draft CLI/daemon integration manifest so the generator can run automatically (Phase 3 requirement).
3. Populate decision log YAML with automation asset moves prior to DirectoryOrganizer execution.
