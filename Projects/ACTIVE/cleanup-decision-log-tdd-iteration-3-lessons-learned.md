# Cleanup Decision Log — TDD Iteration 3 Lessons Learned

## Iteration Overview

- **Feature**: Decision log YAML generation from inventory records with validation and confirmation hooks
- **Branch**: `housekeeping/cleanup-inventory-decision-log`
- **TDD Cycle**: RED test → GREEN implementation → REFACTOR with validation helpers
- **Test Command**: `PYTHONPATH=development pytest development/tests/unit/automation/test_cleanup_decision_log.py`

## What Worked Well

- Single RED test focused on 4 representative record types (project doc, dev doc, automation script, review queue) clarified the transformation requirement.
- GREEN implementation stayed minimal: parse YAML, transform records with `status: pending`, preserve metadata fields.
- Refactoring extracted three validation helpers (`_validate_decision_entry`, `_detect_conflicts`, `_build_confirmation_prompt` callback) without altering test surface.
- Type annotations (`dict[str, Any]`) prevented Mapping immutability issues and clarified intent.

## Challenges & Decisions

- Initial Mapping type for decision entries caused immutability errors; switched to mutable `dict[str, Any]` for entry construction.
- Confirmation callback signature (`Callable[[Mapping], bool]`) allows future CLI integration without modifying core generator.
- Conflict detection logic (duplicate destinations, circular moves) kept simple for GREEN phase; extensible for future daemon scheduling.

## Key Insights

1. **Metadata Preservation**: Automation asset metadata (trigger, monitoring) flows through unchanged, enabling downstream daemon integration.
2. **Validation as Separate Concern**: Extracting `_validate_decision_entry()` and `_detect_conflicts()` keeps generator logic clean and testable.
3. **Callback Pattern**: Optional `on_confirmation` callback enables CLI integration without coupling generator to user interaction.
4. **YAML Round-Trip**: Using `yaml.safe_load()` and `yaml.dump()` ensures inventory → decision log transformation preserves structure.

## Next Steps

1. Extend RED tests for validation scenarios (missing fields, absolute paths, circular moves, duplicate destinations).
2. Implement CLI command `cleanup_demo.py --review-decisions` to display pending moves with user confirmation.
3. Add decision log persistence to `.automation/review_queue/cleanup-decisions-YYYYMMDD-HHMMSS.yaml`.
4. Integrate with DirectoryOrganizer to execute approved moves with metadata flow-through.

## Test Results

- ✅ 5/5 cleanup inventory + decision log tests passing
- ✅ All metadata fields preserved through transformation
- ✅ YAML round-trip integrity verified
- ✅ Zero regressions in existing cleanup inventory tests
