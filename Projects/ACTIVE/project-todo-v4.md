## üü° P1: Next Priorities (After P0 Complete)

### 1. User Experience & Workflow Improvements (NEW - Oct 23, 2025)

**Context**: User feedback session identified key friction points and high-impact improvements  
**Priority**: P1 - Focus on impact over architectural cleanup  
**Timeline**: 4-8 hours across 2-3 sessions

#### üéØ User's Most-Used Workflows
- **Weekly review** - Used regularly
- **Screenshots processing** - Used regularly  
- **YouTube CLI** - Used often
- **Evening processing** - Priority improvement area
- **Automation** - Priority improvement area

#### üî¥ Biggest Pain Points
1. **Visibility Gap**: "Not a lot of visibility into what I am doing"
   - Don't know what automations are running
   - Can't see what happened during processing
   - Hard to troubleshoot when things go wrong
   
2. **Automation Friction**: "Automations are scary/friction to run"
   - Daemons not automatically turned on
   - Everything is CLI, hard to remember
   - No quick status check
   - Fear of breaking things

3. **Note-Taking Friction**: "I wish to take more notes with templates"
   - No quick template system
   - Inconsistent structure
   - Manual setup for each note type

#### üöÄ High-Impact Improvements (Prioritized)

**Phase 1: Automation Visibility CLI** (P1, 1-2 hours) - **HIGHEST IMPACT**
- **Problem**: User doesn't know what's happening with automations
- **Solution**: Create `automation_status_cli.py`
  ```bash
  ./inneros automation status    # Are daemons running?
  ./inneros automation last-run  # What happened in last run?
  ./inneros automation logs      # Show recent logs
  ./inneros automation start     # Easy daemon startup
  ./inneros automation stop      # Easy daemon shutdown
  ```
- **Impact**: Remove fear, increase confidence, enable troubleshooting
- **Success**: User runs automations without anxiety

#### üìã Backlog (Future Work - Needs Refinement)

**Workflow-Triggering Template System** (P2, TBD - concept exploration needed)
- **Concept**: Create templates that trigger InnerOS automations
- **Context**: User already has 13 Templater templates in `knowledge/Templates/`
- **Vision**: Templater note creation ‚Üí InnerOS automation execution
- **Status**: Concept is close to ideal but specific actions need definition
- **Next Steps**: 
  - Define specific workflow triggers needed
  - Determine automation integration points
  - Design template ‚Üí automation handoff mechanism
- **Deferred**: User needs to explore what specific actions would be most valuable

**Evening Screenshots Extraction** (P2, 30 min)
- **Problem**: Added to deprecated workflow_demo.py (violates ADR-004)
- **Solution**: Extract to `evening_screenshots_cli.py`
  - Use existing 5 helper methods
  - Add better progress visibility
  - Show summary of what was processed
- **Impact**: Clean architecture + better UX
- **Success**: User sees what happened during processing

**Phase 4: YouTube CLI Improvements** (P1, 1-2 hours)
- **Problem**: User uses often, wants improvements
- **Action**: Get specific feedback on pain points
  - Too slow?
  - Missing features?
  - Hard to use?
- **Solution**: TBD based on user feedback

#### üìä Workflow Audit Results (28 commands in workflow_demo.py)

**Classification Complete** (Oct 23, 2025):
- **Core Note Management**: 5 commands
- **Weekly/Review**: 3 commands
- **Fleeting Notes**: 2 commands
- **YouTube**: 2 commands
- **Orphaned Notes**: 2 commands
- **Reading Intake**: 2 commands (skeleton)
- **Backup**: 3 commands
- **Safe Workflow**: 6 commands
- **Screenshots**: 2 commands

**Findings**:
- ADR-004 marked "100% complete" but workflow_demo.py still 2,127 LOC
- Commands were duplicated to new CLIs but never removed from monolith
- Need to convert workflow_demo.py to thin router (~800 LOC target)

#### üéØ Long-Term Vision (Future)
- **Dashboard/Web UI**: User wants visibility, but this is a bigger project
- **Focus**: CLI improvements first, dashboard later
- **Principle**: Impact over perfection

#### Success Criteria
- [ ] Automation status CLI created and tested
- [ ] User can check daemon status in <5 seconds
- [ ] Template CLI created with 4+ templates
- [ ] Evening screenshots extracted properly
- [ ] User provides feedback on YouTube improvements
- [ ] User reports reduced anxiety about automations

### 2. CI/CD & DevOps
- **P0 PR CI**: Add `.github/workflows/ci.yml` (ruff, black, pyright, pytest)
- **P0 Security**: Add CodeQL, Dependabot, pip-audit
- **P1 Nightly**: Heavy tests, link-integrity scan, performance smoke tests
- **P1 Pre-commit**: Hooks for code style, linting

### 2. Git Branch Cleanup Sprint
**Status**: üî¥ **CRITICAL TECHNICAL DEBT** - 70+ unmerged feature branches  
**Priority**: P1 - Reducing cognitive overhead and repository complexity  
**Timeline**: 2-3 hours

#### Problem
- **70+ feature branches** across local and remote repositories
- Unclear completion/merge status for many branches
- Context switching overhead when navigating work
- Risk of duplicate work or lost progress
- Repository complexity impacting developer experience

#### Audit & Cleanup Strategy
1. **Categorize Branches** (30 min)
   - ‚úÖ **Merged & Complete**: Delete locally and remotely
   - üîÑ **Ready to Merge**: Review, test, create PRs
   - üöß **In Progress**: Document status, consolidate if possible
   - ‚ùå **Abandoned**: Archive/delete with documentation

2. **Priority Branches to Review** (60 min)
   - `housekeeping/knowledge-base-cleanup-phase2` - Appears complete, merge?
   - Multiple `feat/adr-002-phase-*` branches (12+ phases) - Consolidate?
   - `feat/auto-promotion-subdirectory-support` (current HEAD) - Enhancement, not P0
   - Samsung screenshot workflow branches - Multiple iterations to reconcile
   - YouTube automation branches - May be superseded by merged work

3. **Create Branch Management Process** (30 min)
   - Document "Definition of Done" for branches
   - Establish merge/delete criteria
   - Add weekly branch audit to workflow
   - Create `.github/workflows/stale-branches.yml` to auto-flag old branches

#### Success Criteria
- [ ] Reduce active branches to <20 (from 70+)
- [ ] All "completed" work either merged or documented as archived
- [ ] Clear status for remaining in-progress branches
- [ ] Branch management process documented in workflows/

#### Impact
- **Before**: 70+ branches, unclear status, high cognitive load
- **After**: <20 active branches, clear status, reduced context switching
- **Time Savings**: ~30 min/week reduced navigation overhead

### 3. Inbox Metadata Repair
- Fix 8 notes missing `type:` frontmatter
- Auto-infer from filename patterns
- Enables auto-promotion for remaining notes

### 4. WorkflowManager Decomposition
- Extract ConnectionManager (~300 LOC)
- Extract AnalyticsCoordinator (~400 LOC)
- Extract PromotionEngine (~200 LOC)
- Timeline: Nov 2025 (3-4 sprints)
