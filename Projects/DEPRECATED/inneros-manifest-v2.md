## üéØ Vision & Purpose

InnerOS Zettelkasten is a **local-first, AI-augmented knowledge system** that preserves human decision-making while automating analysis, triage, and connectivity discovery. This system transforms isolated note-taking into an intelligent network that learns, connects, and surfaces insights automatically.

**Core Promise**: "Capture any thought in under 15 seconds, and let AI transform it into connected knowledge that compounds over time."

---

## üèóÔ∏è Current Architecture Status

### **Knowledge Graph Analysis (2025-08-10)**
- **Strong Foundation**: Healthy "hub + clusters" structure with effective MOCs (AI/Prompting, Projects, Concepts, Books, Career & Entrepreneurship)
- **Core Density**: Reasonably dense center with strong workflow/AI backbone connecting engineering/TDD with prompting practice
- **Identified Gaps**: Peripheral singletons, weak bridges between key domains, isolated mini-clusters need integration

### **Technology Stack**
- **AI Engine**: Ollama (Llama 3.1 8B) with semantic embeddings
- **Storage**: Markdown + YAML frontmatter (schema-validated)
- **Processing**: Python 3.9+ with async capabilities, 66/66 tests passing
- **Interface**: CLI (production) ‚Üí Web Dashboard (Phase 6)
- **Analytics**: Network analysis, quality scoring (0-1 scale), temporal insights

---

## üîó Immediate Connectivity Improvement Plan

### **High-Priority Bridge Reinforcement**
1. **AI ‚Üî Pharmacy Bridge**: Strengthen "Perplexity AI Pharmacy Research" and "Pharmacy Scraper Classification Module" with explicit links to embeddings, scraping pipeline design, evaluation strategy
2. **AI/TDD ‚Üî Weekly Review Bridge**: Link "Weekly Review Manifest/Checklist" into TDD/automation cluster and back to MOCs
3. **Entrepreneurship ‚Üî AI Delivery Bridge**: Connect "Upwork as Revenue," "Freelancing Plan," Upwork videos to concrete deliverables (scrapers, dashboards, demos) and "Project ‚Äì Pharmacy Scraper MOC"

### **Strategic Bridge Notes (Create New)**
- **"How AI Prompting Supports TDD and Weekly Review Automation"**: High-value conceptual hub linking AI methods to engineering workflows
- **"LLM Outage Handling Pattern"** and **"Voice-to-Clarity Workflow Pattern"**: Lightweight pattern notes linking tools/experiments

### **Singleton Remediation (Immediate)**
- **Peripheral Notes**: "Pasted image‚Ä¶," "Support SOP System Map," dated diary-style notes need upward (MOC) and lateral links
- **Mini-Clusters**: Claude News Bot/Carousel, voice/prompting utilities need integration into AI & Prompting MOC with "Tools in Practice" section
- **Progress Snapshots**: Convert single-linked dated progress notes into bidirectional connections

### **Cross-MOC Navigation Enhancement**
- Projects MOC ‚Üí AI and Prompting MOC (methods used per project)
- Career & Entrepreneurship MOC ‚Üî Projects MOC (portfolio artifacts bidirectional)
- Add "What to do next" sections in every MOC linking to open tasks/TODOs

## üìÅ Information Architecture

### **Directory Workflow**
| **Stage** | **Directory** | **Status** | **AI Features** |
|-----------|---------------|------------|-----------------|
| **Capture** | `Inbox/` | `status: inbox` | Auto-tagging, quality assessment |
| **Process** | `Fleeting Notes/` | `inbox ‚Üí promoted` | Semantic analysis, connection discovery |
| **Permanent** | `Permanent Notes/` | `draft ‚Üí published` | Summarization, link prediction |
| **Archive** | `Archive/` | `archived` | Compression, historical analysis |

#### Templates (Obsidian Templater)
- `knowledge/Templates/fleeting.md` ‚Äî quick capture with automated rename/move.
- `knowledge/Templates/permanent.md` ‚Äî structured permanent notes.
- `knowledge/Templates/literature.md` ‚Äî literature/reference notes.
- `knowledge/Templates/daily.md`, `weekly-review.md`, `sprint-review.md`, `sprint-retro.md` ‚Äî rituals.
- `knowledge/Templates/chatgpt-prompt.md` ‚Äî Single-prompt ChatGPT prompt note generator.

Usage:
- Requires Obsidian Templater. EJS syntax is used (e.g., `<% tp.date.now("YYYY-MM-DD HH:mm") %>`).
- Prompts once for a feature/branch name, then renames file to `Inbox/prompt-YYYYMMDD-HHmm.md`.
- Starts with `type: fleeting`, `status: inbox`; tags include `prompt, chatgpt, inbox`.

### **YAML Schema (Required)**
```yaml
type: permanent | fleeting | literature | MOC
created: YYYY-MM-DD HH:mm
status: inbox | promoted | draft | published | archived
visibility: private | shared | team | public
tags: [kebab-case, hierarchical]
linked_notes: [[note-name]]
quality_score: 0.0-1.0  # AI-generated
ai_tags: [auto-generated, contextual]
```

### **MOC Strategy**
- **Central Hubs**: AI/Prompting, Concepts, Projects, Books, Career & Entrepreneurship
- **Navigation**: Cross-MOC bidirectional linking with relationship descriptors
- **Action Orientation**: "What to do next" sections linking to tasks/TODOs

## üìö Reading Intake Pipeline - Phase 5 Extension (Immediate)

> **Integration Status**: Critical gaps identified with original proposal  
> **Approach**: Extend existing Phase 5 AI workflows rather than create parallel systems  
> **Reference**: `Projects/reading-intake-integration-analysis.md`

### **Strategic Positioning**
Transform the Reading Intake Pipeline from a standalone project into a **Phase 5 AI workflow extension** that leverages our existing $50K investment in quality scoring, smart tagging, connection discovery, and weekly review automation.

### **Integration Goals**
- **Schema Compatibility**: Extend existing YAML frontmatter with `source:` field
- **AI Leverage**: Use existing quality scoring (0-1 scale) and smart tagging systems
- **Workflow Integration**: Extend existing 5-state lifecycle (inbox‚Üípromoted‚Üídraft‚Üípublished‚Üíarchived)
- **CLI Extension**: Add import commands to existing `workflow_demo.py`
- **Template Alignment**: Use fixed template processing with InnerOS naming conventions

### **Technical Implementation (Aligned)**
```yaml
# Compatible Schema Extension
---
type: fleeting                    # Existing field
created: 2025-08-10 12:00        # Existing field (fixed template bug)
status: inbox                    # Existing workflow state
source:                          # NEW - Reading Pipeline extension
  url: "https://example.com/post"
  title: "Article Title"
  author: "Author Name"
  published_at: "2025-08-07"
  duration: 540
tags: [ai, workflows]            # Existing field
visibility: private              # Existing field
quality_score: 0.0              # Existing AI feature
ai_tags: []                      # Existing AI feature
---
```

### **Critical Path Dependencies**
1. **Template Processing Bug Fix**: Must resolve `{{date}}` syntax failure before implementation
2. **Schema Validation Extension**: Add `source:` field validation to existing systems
3. **AI Workflow Integration**: Ensure import process uses existing quality scoring and tagging

### **Implementation Timeline (Revised)**
- **Week 1** (Aug 11-15): Template bug fix + schema alignment + compatible templates
- **Week 2** (Aug 18-22): Import adapters extending WorkflowManager + CLI integration
- **Week 3** (Aug 25-29): Literature templates + weekly review integration + full testing

### **Success Criteria**
- **All 66/66 tests remain passing** after integration
- **Leverages existing AI capabilities** (no parallel systems)
- **Maintains .windsurfrules.md compliance** (kebab-case naming)
- **Performance**: <30 seconds per item using existing AI processing
