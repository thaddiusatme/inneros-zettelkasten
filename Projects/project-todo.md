## 🎯 Active Sprint: Phase 5.5 (Weekly Review Automation)

### **Goal**: Complete AI-enhanced workflow management with automated weekly review system that surfaces promotion candidates and generates actionable checklists.

### **Priority Features & Recent Fixes**:

#### ✅ Infrastructure Fix Completed (2025-07-31)
- [x] Implement **Default Vault Path Resolver** (env-vars + `.inneros.*` configs)
- [x] Update `WorkflowManager` to auto-detect vault when no path supplied
- [x] Add unit tests `test_vault_path.py`, `test_workflow_manager_default_path.py` (all green)



#### 📋 Weekly Review Checklist Command
- [ ] **Aggregate Inbox Notes Scanner**
  - [ ] Scan `Inbox/` directory for all markdown files
  - [ ] Scan `Fleeting Notes/` directory for notes with `status: inbox` in YAML frontmatter
  - [ ] Combine both sources into unified review list
  - [ ] Handle edge cases (missing YAML, malformed files)

- [ ] **AI-Powered Promotion Recommendations**
  - [ ] Leverage existing `WorkflowManager.process_inbox_note()` for quality assessment
  - [ ] Generate recommendations: `promote_to_permanent`, `move_to_fleeting`, `improve_or_archive`
  - [ ] Use quality score thresholds: >0.7 promote, >0.4 fleeting, <0.4 improve
  - [ ] Include AI rationale and confidence scores

- [ ] **Checklist-Style Output**
  - [ ] Format each note as `- [ ] NoteTitle.md — **Action** (rationale)`
  - [ ] Group by recommendation type with clear visual separation
  - [ ] Include summary stats: "X notes to promote, Y to refine, Z need work"
  - [ ] Add emoji indicators for quick visual scanning

- [ ] **CLI Integration**
  - [ ] Add `--weekly-review` flag to existing `workflow_demo.py`
  - [ ] Create interactive mode for step-by-step processing
  - [ ] Add `--export-checklist` option to save markdown checklist file
  - [ ] Include `--dry-run` mode for safe preview without modifications

#### 🔄 Enhanced Review Features
- [ ] **Extended Note Scanning**
  - [ ] Include `Permanent Notes/` with `status: draft` (ready for publishing)
  - [ ] Identify orphaned notes (no incoming/outgoing links)
  - [ ] Flag stale notes (not updated in configurable days, default 30)
  - [ ] Detect duplicate or similar content candidates

- [ ] **Automation & Scheduling**
  - [ ] Create schedulable review reports (weekly cron job compatibility)
  - [ ] Generate time-series metrics for workflow health tracking
  - [ ] Auto-update changelog with review completion summaries
  - [ ] Integration with existing `NoteAnalytics` dashboard

- [ ] **Export & Tracking**
  - [ ] Export checklists to markdown files with date stamps
  - [ ] Track completion rates and promotion success metrics
  - [ ] Generate workflow improvement recommendations
  - [ ] Create review session templates for consistent process

#### 🐞 Tech-Debt / Test Failures
- [ ] Fix 13 remaining failing integration & unit tests unrelated to vault resolver
- [ ] Investigate accuracy threshold failures in analytics & AI modules
- [ ] Re-enable full test suite to green before refactor phase

#### 🎯 Success Criteria
- [ ] **Performance**: Weekly review completes in <30 seconds for 100+ notes
- [ ] **Accuracy**: AI recommendations achieve >80% user acceptance rate
- [ ] **Usability**: Single command generates actionable checklist requiring no manual aggregation
- [ ] **Integration**: Seamlessly works with existing Phase 5.4 analytics and workflow systems
- [ ] **Testing**: Comprehensive test suite with real-world note scenarios
