## üî¥ Critical - Bug Fixes & System Issues (Ongoing)

#### Bug 1: YAML `created` Property Not Processing üî¥ **BLOCKING TEMPLATE FUNCTIONALITY**
- [x] **‚úÖ COMPLETED: Templater `{{date}}` Processing Fixed** (2025-09-17)
  - **File**: `knowledge/Inbox/fleeting-20250806-1520-bug-images-dissapear.md.md`
  - **Issue**: Line 3 shows `created: {{date:YYYY-MM-DD HH:mm}}` instead of actual timestamp
  - **Expected**: `created: 2025-08-06 15:20` format
  - **Resolution**: Complete template system overhaul using TDD methodology

- [x] **Mitigation Implemented (Engine-Level)**: Preprocess 'created' placeholders in raw frontmatter within `WorkflowManager.process_inbox_note()` to ensure parseable YAML and ISO timestamp normalization (non-destructive; respects dry-run)

- [x] **Unit Tests Added**: Comprehensive tests for placeholder patterns (`{{date}}`, EJS forms) and dry-run no-write behavior across fast/AI paths

- [x] **‚úÖ COMPLETED: Template Processing Chain Fixed**
  - [x] Verified Templater plugin configuration and updated syntax 
  - [x] Updated templates to use proper Templater syntax: `<% tp.date.now("YYYY-MM-DD HH:mm") %>`
  - [x] Created production-grade repair script for vault maintenance
  - [x] Fixed all problematic files in vault (11 files with placeholders resolved)

- [x] **‚úÖ COMPLETED: Production Tooling**: `repair_templater_placeholders.py` script with dry-run, backups, and comprehensive error handling
- [x] **‚úÖ COMPLETED: System Integration**: Template fixes work with AI workflow pipeline and maintain metadata integrity

**üéâ TEMPLATE SYSTEM STATUS: ‚úÖ PRODUCTION READY** - All blocking template issues resolved. See `Projects/Archive/completed-2025-09/templater-placeholder-fix-lessons-learned.md` for complete implementation details.
