# WorkflowManager Refactor - TDD Manifest

**Created**: 2025-10-05  
**Status**: üî¥ **PRIORITY 1 - ARCHITECTURAL DEBT**  
**Priority**: CRITICAL (P1 - Main Focus)  
**Type**: Architecture Refactoring + TDD  
**Estimated Effort**: 4 weeks (AI-driven TDD approach)

---

## üéØ **Mission: Split the God Class**

### **Current State: CRITICAL**
```
File: development/src/ai/workflow_manager.py
Lines: 2,374 (Threshold: 500)
Methods: 59 (Threshold: 10-15)
Test Coupling: 13 test files
Total Imports: 17 files
```

### **Problem**
- **Architectural debt compounding exponentially**
- Every new feature adds to the god class
- TDD gave false confidence (tests check features, not architecture)
- User reported "code smell" for weeks (instinct was correct)

### **Goal**
Split WorkflowManager into 4 focused managers:
1. **CoreWorkflowManager** - Orchestration only (~200 LOC)
2. **AnalyticsManager** - Metrics, reviews, orphans (~400 LOC)
3. **AIEnhancementManager** - Tagging, quality, summarization (~600 LOC)
4. **ConnectionManager** - Links, tags, relationships (~400 LOC)

---

## üìä **Method Categorization (59 Methods)**

### **Category 1: Core Orchestration** (Move to CoreWorkflowManager)
```python
__init__
_load_config
process_inbox_note
promote_note
batch_process_inbox
_fix_template_placeholders

```
**Target LOC**: ~200-300 lines

### **Category 2: Analytics & Metrics** (Move to AnalyticsManager)
```python

detect_orphaned_notes
detect_orphaned_notes_comprehensive
detect_stale_notes
generate_enhanced_metrics
_list_orphans_by_scope
```
**Target LOC**: ~400-500 lines

### **Category 3: AI Enhancement** (Move to AIEnhancementManager)
```python
# AI tagging, quality scoring, summarization
# (Methods to be identified from remaining 59)
```
**Target LOC**: ~500-700 lines

### **Category 4: Connection & Link Management** (Move to ConnectionManager)
```python
remediate_orphaned_notes
_find_default_link_target

## üö® **Risk Management**

### **Risk 1: Test Coupling**
**Issue**: 13 test files directly instantiate WorkflowManager  
**Mitigation**: Migrate tests incrementally, one file at a time  
**Rollback**: Keep old WorkflowManager until all tests passing

### **Risk 2: Breaking Changes**
**Issue**: 17 files import WorkflowManager  
**Mitigation**: Facade pattern - old API delegates to new managers  
**Rollback**: Revert commits if production breaks

### **Risk 3: Time Overrun**
**Issue**: 4 weeks might not be enough  
**Mitigation**: Weekly checkpoints, adjust scope if needed  
**Rollback**: Phase deployment - complete 1 manager at a time

---

## üìù **Architecture Decision Record (ADR)**

### **Decision: Split WorkflowManager into 4 Domain Managers**

**Context**:
- Current WorkflowManager is 2,374 lines, 59 methods (god class)
- TDD iterations kept adding to same class (no refactoring trigger)
- User experienced "code smell" but TDD gave false confidence
- Every new feature makes refactoring harder (exponential debt)

**Options Considered**:
1. **Extract utilities** - Insufficient, doesn't address god class
2. **Create facade** - Hides problem, doesn't fix it
3. **Plugin architecture** - Too complex, premature
4. **Split by domain** - ‚úÖ **SELECTED**: Clean separation, testable

**Decision**:
Split into 4 managers by domain:
- CoreWorkflowManager: Orchestration only
- AnalyticsManager: Metrics and reporting
- AIEnhancementManager: AI processing
- ConnectionManager: Links and relationships

**Consequences**:
- ‚úÖ **Pros**: Clean architecture, testable, maintainable
- ‚úÖ **Pros**: Plugin architecture foundation
- ‚úÖ **Pros**: Easier to add features without coupling
- ‚ùå **Cons**: 4 weeks refactoring time
- ‚ùå **Cons**: 13 test files need migration
- ‚ùå **Cons**: Temporary complexity during migration

**Implementation**:
- AI-driven TDD approach (user's preferred method)
- Incremental migration (maintain green tests throughout)
- Deprecation period (keep old API working via facade)

---

## üéì **Lessons Learned (Pre-mortem)**

### **Why TDD Didn't Catch This**
1. **Tests checked features, not architecture**
2. **No architectural guardrails** (max class size linting)
3. **No refactoring trigger defined** (when to split?)
4. **"Just add another method" culture**

### **What Should Have Happened**
1. **Refactoring trigger at 500 LOC or 15 methods**
2. **Architectural reviews in lessons learned**
3. **Class size tests** (fail if >500 LOC)
4. **Interface-based testing** (not concrete classes)

### **What We'll Do Differently**
1. **Add class size linting** to CI/CD
2. **Architectural reviews** in all future iterations
3. **Interface-first design** for new features
4. **Refactoring as part of TDD** (not just feature completion)

## üìã **Immediate Next Steps**

### **Today (Oct 5)**
- [x] Create this manifest
- [ ] Commit manifest to git
- [ ] Extract all 59 method signatures
- [ ] Begin method categorization
- [ ] Share categorization for review

### **Monday (Oct 6)**
- [ ] Complete method categorization
- [ ] Design 4 manager interfaces
- [ ] Start RED phase (write failing tests)

### **End of Week 1 (Oct 12)**
- [ ] 30 failing tests written
- [ ] Architecture Decision Record complete
- [ ] Ready for GREEN phase

- **Technical Health Assessment**: `Projects/REFERENCE/technical-health-assessment-oct-2025.md`
- **Team Feedback**: (Incorporated into this manifest)
- **Project TODO**: `Projects/ACTIVE/project-todo-v3.md` (update with P1 priority)
- **TDD Lessons Learned**: `Projects/COMPLETED-2025-10/` (28+ previous iterations)

## üéØ **Commitment**

**This is now Priority 1** (after confirming image bug already fixed).

**Why**:
- User's architectural instinct was correct ("code smell")
- Team feedback confirmed critical issue
- Exponential debt if delayed
- Daemon/features blocked until this is fixed

**Timeline**: 4 weeks (Oct 6 - Nov 2, 2025)  
**Owner**: Development Team  
**Blocker**: All new features until refactor complete  
**Go/No-Go**: Weekly checkpoint every Friday

---

**Document Status**: ‚úÖ Planning Complete - Ready for Execution  
**Next Action**: Method categorization (complete list of 59 methods)  
**Target Start**: Monday, October 6, 2025  
**Risk Level**: Medium (incremental approach reduces risk)
