## üéØ Choose Your Next Epic

### Option 1: üé¨ YouTube Integration (P1, 5-7 hours) ‚≠ê RECOMMENDED

**Why This**: Natural extension of auto-promotion system, 37 YouTube notes waiting

**Manifest**: `Projects/ACTIVE/youtube-auto-promotion-integration-manifest.md`

**What You'll Build**:
1. User approval workflow (`ready_to_process: true` flag)
2. AI processing that preserves user notes
3. Quality scoring for video content
4. Auto-promotion to `Literature Notes/YouTube/`
5. Migration script for 37 existing YouTube notes
6. CLI integration: `inneros youtube process --approve`

**6 Implementation Phases**:
- Phase 1 (1h): Metadata schema update
- Phase 2 (1.5h): YouTube-specific AI processor
- Phase 3 (1h): Auto-promotion integration
- Phase 4 (1h): Migration script
- Phase 5 (1h): CLI commands
- Phase 6 (1.5h): Testing & validation

**Success Criteria**:
- YouTube notes flow through complete workflow
- User maintains control via approval flag
- Existing user notes preserved
- All 37 notes successfully migrated

**Dependencies**: None (auto-promotion complete)

---

### Option 2: üü° Source Code Reorganization (P1, Gradual 4-6 weeks)

**Why This**: Improve developer experience, 90% faster code discovery

**Manifest**: `Projects/ACTIVE/source-code-reorganization-manifest.md`

**The Problem**:
- `src/ai/` - 56 Python files (impossible to navigate)
- `src/cli/` - 44 Python files (cognitive overload)
- Current: 20+ minutes to find related code
- Target: <2 minutes (90% improvement)

**80/20 Approach** (Proof of Concept - Week 1):
1. **Phase 1** (2h): Extract `ai/connections/` (12 files)
2. **Phase 2** (2h): Extract `ai/tags/` (10 files)
3. **Phase 3** (1h): Validate all tests still pass
4. **Phase 4** (1h): Go/No-Go decision

**If Successful, Continue With**:
- Week 2-3: Remaining ai/ domains (5 more)
- Week 4-5: CLI feature splitting (7 features)
- Week 6: Consolidate utilities + create models/ package

**Success Criteria**:
- Zero test regressions (100% passing throughout)
- <2 minute average code discovery time
- Clear domain boundaries
- Import paths still work

**Dependencies**: None (can start anytime)

**Risk**: Medium (affects many files, but comprehensive test suite protects)

---

### Option 3: üêõ Quality Audit Bug Fixes (P2, 2-3 hours)

**Why This**: Quick wins, low effort, improves stability

**Known Bugs** (From October 2025 quality audit):
1. **Connection Discovery Import Error** (5 min)
   - Simple import path fix
   - Low impact (feature still works)
   
2. **4 Minor Bugs in Monolithic CLI** (2 hours)
   - Deferred during ADR-004 extraction
   - Low priority, cosmetic issues
   - Details in quality audit report

**Success Criteria**:
- All 5 bugs fixed
- Zero regressions
- Update quality audit status

**Dependencies**: None

**Risk**: Low (isolated fixes, good test coverage)

---

### Option 4: üîµ Distribution System (P1, 2-3 weeks)

**Why This**: Make InnerOS installable by others, enable user testing

**Manifest**: `Projects/ACTIVE/adr-003-distribution-architecture.md`

**Current State**: Only works in development environment

**Goal**: pip-installable package with proper CLI entry points

**5 Implementation Phases**:
1. **Phase 1** (3 days): Package structure (setup.py, pyproject.toml)
2. **Phase 2** (2 days): CLI entry points (inneros command globally available)
3. **Phase 3** (3 days): Configuration management (vault path detection)
4. **Phase 4** (3 days): Installation documentation + quick start
5. **Phase 5** (3 days): Release automation (GitHub Actions)

**Success Criteria**:
- `pip install inneros-zettelkasten` works
- `inneros status` works from anywhere
- Documentation for new users
- Automated releases to PyPI

**Dependencies**: None (code organization helps but not required)

**Risk**: Medium (packaging complexity, path resolution)
