# Design Flaw Audit - Quick Start Guide

**Created**: 2025-10-08  
**Purpose**: Run audit and fix critical issues ASAP  
**Time**: ~30 minutes initial audit, ongoing fixes

---

## üöÄ Quick Start (Do This NOW)

### **Step 1: Run the Audit** (2 minutes)
```bash
# Make script executable
chmod +x .automation/scripts/audit_design_flaws.sh

# Run audit
.automation/scripts/audit_design_flaws.sh > audit_results_$(date +%Y%m%d).txt

# View results
less audit_results_$(date +%Y%m%d).txt
```

---

### **Step 2: Review Critical Findings** (10 minutes)

**Focus on these 2 categories ONLY**:

1. **üî• Unbounded Resource Consumption**
   - Look for: API calls without limits
   - Look for: While loops without breaks
   - Look for: Retry logic without max attempts

2. **üíæ Data Loss Risks**
   - Look for: File writes without backups
   - Look for: Destructive operations (rm, rmtree)
   - Look for: Overwrites without context managers

---

### **Step 3: Create Issue List** (10 minutes)

For each finding, document:
```markdown
## Issue #X: [Brief description]
- **Category**: Unbounded Resource / Data Loss
- **File**: path/to/file.py:123
- **Severity**: P0 (Critical) / P1 (High) / P2 (Medium)
- **Risk**: What could go wrong?
- **Fix**: What needs to be done?
- **Effort**: 1 hour / 1 day / 1 week
```

---

### **Step 4: Fix P0 Issues** (Immediate)

**P0 Criteria** (drop everything and fix):
- Could cause financial damage
- Could lose user data
- Could crash system repeatedly

**Example P0**:
- API calls without retry limits (like YouTube incident)
- File operations without backups
- Destructive operations without confirmation

---

## üìä What the Audit Finds

### **7 Categories Checked**

| Category | What It Finds | Severity |
|----------|--------------|----------|
| üî• Unbounded Resource | Infinite loops, unlimited API calls | CRITICAL |
| üíæ Data Loss Risks | Overwrites without backup | CRITICAL |
| üí• Error Boundaries | Missing try/except, bare except | HIGH |
| üö∞ Resource Leaks | File handles not closed | HIGH |
| üèÉ Race Conditions | File watchers, check-then-act | MEDIUM |
| üêå Performance | Nested loops, no pagination | LOW |
| üîí Security | Hardcoded secrets, shell injection | HIGH |

---

## üéØ Priority Guidelines

### **P0 - Critical (Fix Immediately)**
- **Unbounded operations** with external APIs
- **Data loss risks** (overwrites, deletes)
- **Hardcoded secrets** in code

**Timeframe**: Fix within 24 hours

---

### **P1 - High (Fix This Week)**
- **Missing error handling** on critical paths
- **Resource leaks** (file handles, connections)
- **Security issues** (shell injection)

**Timeframe**: Fix within 7 days

---

### **P2 - Medium (Fix Soon)**
- **Race conditions** (file watchers)
- **Performance issues** (O(n¬≤) algorithms)
- **Code smells** (bare except clauses)

**Timeframe**: Fix within 30 days

---

## üîß Common Fixes

### **Fix 1: Add Retry Limits**

**Before** ‚ùå:
```python
while not success:
    try:
        result = api_call()
        success = True
    except:
        continue  # ‚ùå Infinite retries
```

**After** ‚úÖ:
```python
max_retries = 3
for attempt in range(max_retries):
    try:
        result = api_call(timeout=30)
        break
    except Exception as e:
        if attempt == max_retries - 1:
            raise
        time.sleep(2 ** attempt)  # Exponential backoff
```

---

### **Fix 2: Add Backups Before Overwrites**

**Before** ‚ùå:
```python
with open(file_path, 'w') as f:
    f.write(new_content)  # ‚ùå Original lost
```

**After** ‚úÖ:
```python
# Backup first
backup_path = f"{file_path}.backup.{timestamp()}"
shutil.copy2(file_path, backup_path)

# Then write
try:
    with open(file_path, 'w') as f:
        f.write(new_content)
except Exception as e:
    shutil.copy2(backup_path, file_path)  # Rollback
    raise
```

---

### **Fix 3: Replace Bare Except**

**Before** ‚ùå:
```python
try:
    risky_operation()
except:  # ‚ùå Catches everything
    pass
```

**After** ‚úÖ:
```python
try:
    risky_operation()
except SpecificException as e:  # ‚úÖ Specific exception
    logger.error(f"Failed: {e}")
    # Handle or re-raise
```

---

### **Fix 4: Use Context Managers**

**Before** ‚ùå:
```python
f = open(file_path)
data = f.read()
f.close()  # ‚ùå Might not execute
```

**After** ‚úÖ:
```python
with open(file_path) as f:  # ‚úÖ Always closes
    data = f.read()
```

## üìà Track Your Progress

### **Audit Dashboard** (Update weekly)

```markdown
# Audit Progress - Week of YYYY-MM-DD

## Issues Found
- Total: X
- P0 (Critical): X
- P1 (High): X
- P2 (Medium): X

## Issues Fixed
- This week: X
- Total fixed: X
- Remaining: X

## Top 3 Risks Still Open
1. [Description] - P0 - ETA: [date]
2. [Description] - P1 - ETA: [date]
3. [Description] - P1 - ETA: [date]
```

---

## üîÑ Ongoing Process

### **Weekly Audit** (Every Monday)
```bash
# Run audit
.automation/scripts/audit_design_flaws.sh > audit_$(date +%Y%m%d).txt

# Compare to last week
diff audit_$(date -v-7d +%Y%m%d).txt audit_$(date +%Y%m%d).txt

# New issues = red flag
# Fewer issues = progress ‚úÖ
```

---

### **Pre-Commit Checks** (Future)
```bash
# Add to .git/hooks/pre-commit
#!/bin/bash

# Check for common patterns before commit
if git diff --cached --name-only | grep '\.py$'; then
    # Check for bare except
    if git diff --cached | grep -q "except:$"; then
        echo "‚ùå Found bare except clause - fix before commit"
        exit 1
    fi
    
    # Check for hardcoded secrets
    if git diff --cached | grep -q "API_KEY.*=.*['\"]"; then
        echo "‚ùå Found potential hardcoded secret - fix before commit"
        exit 1
    fi
fi
```

## ‚úÖ Success Checklist

**Initial Audit**:
- [ ] Run audit script
- [ ] Review results
- [ ] Create issue list
- [ ] Prioritize (P0/P1/P2)

**Critical Fixes** (This Week):
- [ ] Fix all P0 issues
- [ ] Verify fixes don't break tests
- [ ] Document fixes in commit messages
- [ ] Re-run audit to confirm

**Ongoing**:
- [ ] Run audit weekly
- [ ] Track progress in dashboard
- [ ] Implement circuit breaker (ADR-002)
- [ ] Add pre-commit hooks

**Remember**: You already had ONE catastrophic incident. Don't wait for a second one to fix these issues!

**Your incident could have cost $120-1,000+ with paid APIs. This audit prevents that.**
