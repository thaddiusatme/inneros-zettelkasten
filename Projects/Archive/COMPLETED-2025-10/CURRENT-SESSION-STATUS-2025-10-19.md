# Session Status: YouTube Template Integration

**Date**: 2025-10-19 17:05 PDT  
**Duration**: ~25 minutes  
**Status**: 🟢 **STABLE** - Rolled back to working state after failed template fix attempt

---

## 🎯 Session Summary

### **What We Attempted**
Tried to fix double `.md.md` extension bug in YouTube template using TDD methodology.

### **What Happened**
1. ✅ Created comprehensive tests (9/9 passing)
2. ✅ Made minimal template changes (3 lines)
3. ❌ Templater plugin cached bad state and threw errors
4. ✅ Successfully rolled back to stable version

### **Current State: STABLE ✅**
- Template restored to last known working version
- Flask API server running on `localhost:8080`
- Tests cleaned up
- System ready for use

---

## 🔧 What's Working

### **1. Flask API Server**
```bash
Status: 🟢 RUNNING
URL: http://localhost:8080
PID: 9211 (background process)

Endpoints:
  GET  /health
  POST /api/youtube/process
  GET  /api/youtube/queue
```

### **2. YouTube Template**
```
Status: 🟢 WORKING (with known bug)
Location: knowledge/Templates/youtube-video.md
Bug: Creates double .md extension in YouTube/ subdirectory
  Example: lit-20251019-1648-how-i-use-llms.md.md
Impact: Minor - files still work, just ugly names
```

### **3. Automation Daemon**
```
Status: 🔴 OFFLINE (by choice)
Start: ./development/inneros daemon start
Purpose: 24/7 automation (not required for YouTube workflow)
```

---

## 📊 System State

### **Services**
- ✅ Flask API Server: Running (port 8080)
- ❌ Automation Daemon: Offline (not needed currently)
- ✅ Obsidian: Ready to use
- ✅ Templates: Working (with minor bug)

### **Files Modified (Rolled Back)**
- ✅ `knowledge/Templates/youtube-video.md` - RESTORED to stable
- 🗑️ Deleted: Test files from failed attempt
- 🗑️ Deleted: Documentation from failed attempt

### **Git Status**
```
Branch: feat/youtube-api-templater-integration-tdd-2
Staged: TDD Iteration 2 files (stable)
Unstaged: Config changes, cache updates
Clean: No broken changes
```

---

## 🐛 Known Issues

### **Issue 1: Double .md Extension (Minor)**
**Impact**: Low - Cosmetic issue  
**Location**: Files in `Inbox/YouTube/` subdirectory  
**Example**: `lit-20251019-1648-how-i-use-llms.md.md`  
**Workaround**: Files still work, just have ugly names  
**Fix Attempted**: Rolled back due to Templater plugin issues  
**Status**: Deferred - can address later when system is more stable

### **Issue 2: Templater Plugin Cached State**
**Impact**: Resolved by rollback  
**Cause**: Plugin cached template during our changes  
**Solution**: Rollback + Obsidian restart  
**Status**: ✅ RESOLVED

---

## 💡 Lessons Learned

### **What Went Right**
1. ✅ TDD methodology properly identified the bug
2. ✅ Tests were comprehensive (9/9 passing)
3. ✅ Template fix was technically correct
4. ✅ Rollback was clean and fast
5. ✅ Git workflow protected us from breaking changes

### **What Went Wrong**
1. ❌ Didn't test in actual Obsidian before committing
2. ❌ Templater plugin caching wasn't anticipated
3. ❌ Should have created backup before testing
4. ❌ Moved too fast without validation step

### **Improvements for Next Time**
1. **Always test in Obsidian first** before considering changes complete
2. **Document Templater cache clearing** as part of testing workflow
3. **Create branch-specific test notes** to avoid polluting main vault
4. **Add manual validation step** to TDD workflow for templates
5. **Consider Templater quirks** as part of test design

---

## 🚀 Next Steps

### **Immediate (Now)**
1. ✅ Rollback complete - system is stable
2. ⏭️ Restart Obsidian (clear Templater cache)
3. ⏭️ Test YouTube template with fresh state
4. ⏭️ Verify Flask API receives requests correctly

### **Short Term (Next Session)**
1. Document double .md bug properly (not urgent)
2. Consider if bug fix is worth the risk (probably not)
3. Focus on getting YouTube automation working end-to-end
4. Test actual transcript processing with API

### **Long Term (Future)**
1. Create isolated test vault for template changes
2. Document Templater plugin behavior and quirks
3. Build template testing framework if needed
4. Consider alternative approaches to filename issue

## 🎯 Current Priorities

### **P0: Keep System Stable** ✅
- Don't make template changes without thorough testing
- Keep Flask API server running
- Document known issues clearly

### **P1: Validate End-to-End Workflow**
- Test YouTube note creation → API call → Processing
- Verify transcript fetching works
- Validate quote extraction integrates properly

### **P2: Address Double .md Bug (Optional)**
- Only if becomes blocking issue
- Only with proper isolated testing
- Only with full Templater understanding

## 📞 Quick Reference

### **Start Flask API**
```bash
cd development
python3 run_youtube_api_server.py
# Runs on http://localhost:8080
```

### **Check API Health**
```bash
curl http://localhost:8080/health
```

### **Create YouTube Note**
1. Cmd+P → "Templater: Create new note from template"
2. Select "youtube-video"
3. Paste YouTube URL
4. Answer prompts
5. Note created with API call triggered automatically

### **Troubleshoot Templater**
1. Check Obsidian Developer Console (Cmd+Option+I)
2. Restart Obsidian (Cmd+Q, reopen)
3. Check Templater settings → User Scripts folder
4. Verify script exists: `.obsidian/scripts/trigger_youtube_processing.js`
