# Voice Note Prompts for Knowledge Capture

**Date**: 2025-09-22  
**Purpose**: Structured prompts to optimize Samsung S23 screenshot + voice note captures  
**Context**: InnerOS Knowledge Capture System with AI workflow integration

## üéØ **Quick Reference Card**

### **The 3-2-1 Formula (30 seconds max)**
1. **Context** (10s): What am I looking at and why?
2. **Insight** (10s): What's the key takeaway or connection?
3. **Action** (10s): What should I do with this information?

## üì± **By Content Type**

### **üì∞ Article/Reading Captures**
```
"This is from [source/website/book]. 
The main idea is [key concept].
This connects to my work on [project/area] because [connection].
I should [action: save quote, research more, apply to project]."
```

**Example**: *"This is from a TechCrunch article about AI workflow automation. The main idea is that small AI integrations compound into major productivity gains. This connects to my InnerOS project because we're seeing exactly this with the capture system. I should document this as validation for our approach."*

This could solve [problem] by [approach].
The next step is [specific action].
This relates to [existing project/note]."
```

**Example**: *"I just realized the capture system could work for meeting notes too. This could solve the problem of forgetting context by automatically linking screenshots of slides to voice recordings. Next step is to test this in my next team meeting. This relates to the workflow automation project."*

## üéØ **By Purpose/Goal**

### **üîç Quick Context (15-20 seconds)**
```
"Context: [what/where/when]
Key point: [main takeaway]  
Action: [what I'll do with this]"
```

### **üß† Deep Analysis (30-45 seconds)**
```
"I'm capturing [topic] because [reason].
What I'm seeing is [description].
This connects to [existing knowledge/project] through [connection].
The implications are [analysis].
My next steps are [specific actions]."
```

### **üîó Connection Building (20-30 seconds)**
```
"This relates to [Note A] and [Note B] because [connection].
The pattern I'm seeing is [insight].
This suggests [hypothesis/conclusion].
I should link this to [specific notes/projects]."
```

## ‚ö° **Speed Prompts (Under 15 seconds)**

### **üìù Note-to-Self**
*"Note to self: [key insight]. Follow up: [action]."*

### **üîñ Quick Save** 
*"Saving this [content type] about [topic]. Main point: [key idea]."*

### **üéØ Action Item**
*"Action needed: [what to do] for [project/context]. Due: [when]."*

### **üí≠ Random Insight**

## üè∑Ô∏è **Context Tags to Include**

Add these verbal "tags" to help AI processing:

### **Project Tags**
- "For my [project name] project"  
- "Related to [area of work]"
- "Part of my research on [topic]"

### **Priority Tags**
- "High priority" / "Low priority"
- "Urgent follow-up needed"
- "Nice to have / reference material"

### **Connection Tags**
- "This links to my note on [topic]"
- "Similar to what I captured about [subject]"
- "Contradicts my earlier thinking on [area]"

## üìã **Sample Complete Captures**

### **Example 1: Article Capture (28 seconds)**
*"I'm reading this Hacker News article about knowledge management systems. The key insight is that AI tagging works best when combined with human context. This validates our approach in the InnerOS project where we use AI for initial processing but keep human review. I should add this as evidence in our methodology documentation."*

### **Example 2: Meeting Insight (25 seconds)**  
*"In today's team standup, Sarah mentioned the customer feedback about our workflow being too complex. This matches what I've been thinking about our capture system - we need to optimize for simplicity. I should design the next iteration with a focus on reducing friction. This connects to my notes on user experience design."*

### **Example 3: Technical Discovery (32 seconds)**
*"Found a bug in our template processing system where YAML timestamps aren't parsing correctly. The error shows created field with Templater tokens instead of actual dates. This is blocking the Reading Intake Pipeline development. Next step is to fix the preprocessing in workflow manager. This relates to the critical bug I documented last week."*

## üé§ **Voice Recording Best Practices**

### **Technical Tips**
- **Speak clearly** at normal pace (not rushed)
- **Use specific names** for projects, people, tools
- **Include dates** when relevant ("today's meeting", "last week's discussion")
- **State connections explicitly** ("this relates to...", "this builds on...")

### **Content Structure**
1. **Start with context** - where/what/when
2. **State the main point** - key insight or information  
3. **Make connections** - how it relates to existing knowledge
4. **End with action** - what you'll do next

### **Timing Guidelines**
- **Minimum**: 10 seconds (enough for basic context)
- **Sweet spot**: 20-30 seconds (context + insight + action)
- **Maximum**: 45 seconds (detailed analysis)

## üöÄ **Integration with AI System**

### **AI Will Extract**
- **Key topics and themes** from your voice content
- **Project/area connections** based on verbal tags
- **Action items and follow-ups** from your stated next steps
- **Priority levels** from your tone and explicit tags

### **AI Will Generate**
- **Relevant tags** based on voice content + screenshot analysis
- **Quality scores** higher for well-structured voice notes
- **Connection suggestions** to existing notes based on mentioned topics
- **Enhancement recommendations** based on gaps in your context

### **Optimization Tips**
- **Use consistent project names** for better AI linking
- **Mention specific note titles** you want to connect to
- **State your reasoning** for better AI insight extraction
- **Include next steps** for better action item generation
